<p class="">I launched this page in conjunction with my third article for Tenkara Angler “Conversing In Japanese” to help those on the journey of learning Japanese. I have been studying the Japanese language since the Fall of 2015.</p>

<p class="">Without further ado I have compiled this list of helpful resources for those learning Japanese. If you have any questions or would like to add a resource to the list please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

<p class="">A list of helpful mobile phone applications can be found here (in particular I am a huge fan of Tae Kim’s Guide to Learning Japanese scroll down to David W. comments</p>

<p class="">The Tenkara Word Bank is an excellent resource. I have saved it to my offline Evernote notebook “Tenkara” for reference when away from cell reception/wi-fi.</p>
