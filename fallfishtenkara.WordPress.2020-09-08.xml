		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Back in July my friend Junpei asked me if I wanted to go to a Japanese music festival on Hachijojima, a tiny island off the coast of Japan. The music festival called Liquid Groove Drop, was a mix of Indian music, techno, and elctronic dance music. The venue was the Yokotoike Ura Beach (横問ヶ浦) on the west side of the island. I was intrigued and after doing some research on the island I emphatically said "YES!"

<img class="size-large wp-image-4110 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hachijojima-izu-islands-philippine-sea-Fuji_Hakone_Izu-National-Park-1024x576.jpg" alt="hachijojima-izu-islands-philippine-sea-fuji_hakone_izu-national-park" width="1024" height="576" data-id="4110" />
<ul>
 	<li>Hachijojima (八丈島) is one of thirteen Izu Islands that are located in the Philippine Sea off the east coast of Japan.</li>
 	<li>Nine of these islands are populated, Hachijojima being one of the largest and the only one with an airport that offers regular flights.</li>
 	<li>Hachijojima is a popular destination for scuba divers and snorkelers as the Kuroshio Current keeps the water very warm.</li>
 	<li>In the 50's and 60's Japan promoted the island as the "Hawaii of Japan".</li>
 	<li>With nearly 60km of coastline, much of it inaccessible due to huge sea cliffs, and two large volcanos on each end of the island - the area is rife with natural beauty.</li>
</ul>
<img class="size-large wp-image-4111 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hachijojima-izu-islands-philippine-sea-Fuji_Hakone_Izu-National-Park-panorama-1024x309.jpg" alt="hachijojima-izu-islands-philippine-sea-fuji_hakone_izu-national-park-panorama" width="1024" height="309" data-id="4111" />

You can get to the island either via ANA which has three flights a day from Haneda Airport or via an overnight ferry. The ferry departs at 10:30pm from Tokyo and arrives at 8:50am the next day. Our friend chose the ferry while my wife and I splurged and got a plane ticket. While the island has a lot of options for lodging we chose the free camping option. At first we were planning on camping at the only campground on the island, but due to the event staff using the campground as living quarters the city opened up Plaza Park (<a href="https://blog.goo.ne.jp/super_asanuma/e/4d75a98bfabb04fce5ffce08de6354a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">八丈プラザ公園</a>) for us to camp at. The park had a bathroom and a covered BBQ area with sinks which was nice.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4109 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hachijojima-izu-islands-philippine-sea-Fuji_Hakone_Izu-National-Park-campground-1024x768.jpg" alt="hachijojima-izu-islands-philippine-sea-fuji_hakone_izu-national-park-campground" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4109" />

Typically you are not allowed to camp at the park but for the event the city made an exception. The free campground is located right next to Sokotsuchi Beach (<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.jp/Attraction_Review-g1091151-d2299205-Reviews-Sokodo_Beach-Hachijo_machi_Hachijo_jima_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">底土海水浴場</a>) which is an excellent place to snorkel - something that we did every day we were there.

The snorkeling is amazing on this island, the water is warm and we saw all manner of sea creatures swimming about in the coral reefs. I even pet a sea turtle that swam right up to me! My friend brought his spear and we tried to get a Yellowfin Tuna or two that we saw swimming about in huge schools, but they were too fast. I would have posted a lot of photos of the underwater paradise but our waterproof Nikon camera turned out to not be that waterproof.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4113 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hachijojima-izu-islands-philippine-sea-Fuji_Hakone_Izu-National-Park-views-1024x768.jpg" alt="hachijojima-izu-islands-philippine-sea-fuji_hakone_izu-national-park-views" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4113" />

The next day we visited Uramigataki Onsen (<a href="https://www.town.hachijo.tokyo.jp/onsen/uramigataki.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">湯裏見ヶ滝温泉</a>) which is located at the confluence of the Miharakawa (三原川) and the Yasukawa (安川) <a href="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/三原川-八丈島.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> (original <a href="https://www.hachijo.gr.jp/pdf/iwo-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>). The Yasukawa flows from a nice looking lake. Perhaps it has fish in it? I am not sure because I didn't bring the right equipment for fresh water fishing (aka my Tenkara rod) as I didn’t think there were any rivers on the island besides a few seasonal drainages... I was wrong.

[caption id="attachment_4115" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4115 size-large" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hachijojima-izu-islands-philippine-sea-Fuji_Hakone_Izu-National-Park-Uramigataki-Onsen-1024x768.jpg" alt="hachijojima-izu-islands-philippine-sea-fuji_hakone_izu-national-park-uramigataki-onsen" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4115" /> The onsen is male and female - bathing suits mandatory. It sits between two waterfalls and a third one below the onsen.[/caption]

&nbsp;

To get around the island we rented bicycles for ¥1500 a day per person. One day we rented a car that cost ¥3000 per day and ¥1000 extra for optional insurance. The rental office is located in the Mobil Gas Station. They also rent scooters and go carts. The later is ¥1000 per hour - I am not sure how much scooters cost to rent (also note the go carts don't come with a helmet...). The attendant spoke good English and they were all quite friendly.

As far as dining options on the island we BBQ'd several dinners at our campsite but we did have lunch at Isozakain (いそざきえん) which was absolutely amazing and quite cheap at ¥1600 per person (they do have several options - the most expensive is ¥5500 per person). Also the Yakinuku Restaurant (名月苑) served delicious ramen and gyoza as well as an extensive menu of Chinese food (they are located across the street from the big police station on 216). There are so many restaurants on the island that you'd probably need to stay for a week plus to try them all.

Of course I would be remiss to not mention the music festival, one of the main reasons why we came. The first night there was a torrential downpour (that flooded our tent) and so we opted not to ride our bikes the 2km in the dark to the festival. The second night the weather was great. The half moon was radiating on the ocean and the sky was filled with stars while silver cotton ball clouds drifted through the black night sky.

We stayed out pretty late but not too late because we had an early morning the next day. We were headed to the even smaller island called Aogoshima!

		<title>Tosaku - Handmade Bamboo Fishing Rods</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Before the age of graphite, carbon fiber, and fiber glass fishing rods were typically made out of bamboo. In Japan the bamboo fishing rod is called wazao and is considered an art form, with craftsman spending a lifetime perfecting their art. Unfortunately, this exquisite art form is becoming more and more rare in Japan. This is due in part to decrease in demand, a decline in the availability of the necessary materials, and the fact that the trade does not provide enough income to compete with modern wages. In an effort to keep the tradition alive <a href="https://tosaku.jp" target="_blank">Tosaku 东作</a>, which has been creating hand made fishing rods from bamboo for eight generations, has modernized their business model. Their main office is located a brisk 10 minute walk from Ueno Station in Tokyo and I highly recommend, that if you are in the area, you drop by.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4140 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Tosaku-ueno-tokyo-japan-bamboo-fishing-rods-768x1024.jpg" alt="tosaku-ueno-tokyo-japan-bamboo-fishing-rods" width="768" height="1024" data-id="4140" />

I came across Tosaku's website (they are the only wazao manufacturer with a modern website, part of their effort to stay afloat) after reading an article in <a href="https://craftsmanship.net/bamboo-take-two-japans-gorgeous-precarious-fishing-poles/" target="_blank">Craftsmanship</a>. After reading the article I knew I needed to stop in and take a look at their lineup. Well that opportunity came when I found myself in Ueno visiting the Sansui Fishing Store to buy some fly tying equipment. Since the Tasaku office is so close I obviously had to stop in.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4141 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Tosaku-ueno-tokyo-japan-bamboo-fishing-rods-tamo-768x1024.jpg" alt="tosaku-ueno-tokyo-japan-bamboo-fishing-rods-tamo" width="768" height="1024" data-id="4141" />

The store has two isles, which are barely wide enough to fit down. All the shelves are loaded with bamboo rods and all other sorts of wooden fishing goods (e.g. tamos, bait boxes, wooden reels, etc...) The owner, Kouhei Matsumoto, and his wife were inventorying goods in the back but when I introduced myself they were very excited to show me around. I told them I was interested in Tenkara and he quickly ran to the front of the shop, grabbed a rod, and directed me outside. Once outside Matsumoto-san showed me an absolutely gorgeous three piece bamboo Tenkara rod. The action was indescribably beautiful, I want one... No I need one. I swore I would never pay more than $300 for a rod but for this rod I will make an exception.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4142 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Tosaku-ueno-tokyo-japan-bamboo-fishing-rods-tenkara-rod-demo-768x1024.jpg" alt="tosaku-ueno-tokyo-japan-bamboo-fishing-rods-tenkara-rod-demo" width="768" height="1024" data-id="4142" />

It was a very hot day in Tokyo so after a brief demo we returned to the cool air conditioned shop and chatted about fish. They presented me with a gift, a Tosaku scarf and after a few quick photos we exchanged business cards, and I returned to the streets of Tokyo - a smile on my face thoughts running through my head about the fish I would catch on their bamboo rod when I returned to buy my own.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Before I moved to Japan my wife's Grandma emailed me an article about a tiny island, way out in the ocean off the coast of Japan. She sent it to me with a quick note <em>"You should visit this island sometime - Love, Grandma"</em>. After reading up on the island and how remote it is and difficult to access I was sold on visiting. Well it just so happens that the only way to get to the island is by ferry or helicopter, both of which depart from Hachijojima. Since we were already going to be there for the music festival we made plans to tack on a visit to this island, which is known as Aogashima, to our trip.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4202 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-edit-1024x768.jpg" alt="aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-edit" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4202" />

Unfortunately, the helicopter service to the island has limited seats available and you can only book flights starting at noon 30 days prior to your trip. I logged on at 3pm and they were already sold out! So we were stuck with the <a href="https://www.vill.aogashima.tokyo.jp/access/aogashima_operating_list.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ferry</a>. The <a href="https://tohoair-tal.jp/ext/fare.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helicopter ride</a> costs ¥18,000+ per person round trip and the ferry costs ¥5,500 per person round trip. While the ferry is obviously much cheaper, it is also very unreliable. The island has no natural harbor so if the seas are too rough the ferry is cancelled for the day. You can call (+81-4996-9-0033) the ferry at 0700 the day of your intended trip to find out if they are operating. If they are, there is one ferry that departs at 0930 and arrives at the island around three hours later.

[caption id="attachment_4156" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4156 size-large" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-departing-hachijojima-1024x294.jpg" alt="aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-departing-hachijojima" width="1024" height="294" data-id="4156" /> Departing Hachijojima[/caption]

We called the ferry at 0700 and luckily for us they were running. It was a mad scramble to tear down our campsite on Hachijojima and return our rental car and bikes. It was a hectic morning but we boarded the ferry with five minutes to spare. Once we left the island the skies cleared and the sun came out. The seas were still pretty rough but thankfully the Aogashima Maru (our ferry) was quite stable and we never got seasick. When Aogashima came into view, some three hours later, we were absolutely blown away by how blue the water was, how green the island was, and how rugged and austere it all looked.

[caption id="attachment_4159" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4159 size-large" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-aogashima-port-1024x768.jpg" alt="aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-aogashima-port" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4159" /> There is no natural port and the seas are so rough that they've built a crane to pluck the fishing boats from the ocean and put them on a platform on the side of a cliff![/caption]

Upon landing safely on Aogashima we were met by a city employee who told us that we needed to register at the city office by 5pm. We were also told that there were two rental car companies on the island but only one rented to campers. A city employee, who also apparently owned the rental car company, gave us a ride to the rental shop, where we transferred our luggage into our rental <a href="http://104.248.67.90/japanese-kei-cars/">kei van</a>, and then we followed the city employee to the city office to register. At the city office we also picked out our campsite (we chose #8 &amp; #9). After registering we made our way to the grocery store but on the way our car broke down and would not start again. So we called the lady up and she quickly returned and gave us a ride back to the rental car shop where we got another car (the cost is ¥5,500 per day including gas and insurance).

[caption id="attachment_4161" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4161 size-large" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-rental-car-1024x768.jpg" alt="aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-rental-car" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4161" /> The rental car place (the electric Kei van is the owners)[/caption]

After dealing with the car debacle we returned to the grocery store and bought dinner (there are no restaurants on the island. However, there are two Izakayas - one of which is only open on Wednesday). Then we drove to our campsite and set up camp.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4162 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-campsite-1024x768.jpg" alt="aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-campsite" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4162" />

The campground is inside the crater on the side of the smaller volcano. The smaller volcano has many vents spewing steam out of the ground. We were told that sometimes the ground in the campsite can get very hot. I was skeptical about this, thinking maybe it was a lost in translation moment but it is very true - as I found out in the middle of the night.

A short three minute walk from camp is the island's only onsen/sauna. The water and the sauna are heated by the volcanic steam and the ground all around the onsen is very hot.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4163 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-pudding-volcano-1024x768.jpg" alt="aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-pudding-volcano" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4163" />

After setting up camp we drove back down to the port and did some snorkeling and spear fishing. My friend got a fish (!) but our swim was cut short when he was stung by a jellyfish (possibly a Portuguese Man-O-War). We piled back in the car and drove to the grocery store to get him some vinegar and then we headed to the onsen for a nice long soak. Between those two natural remedies the swelling went down quickly and within a few hours he was feeling much better. According to one of the locals August and September is the jellyfish migration, so if you are visiting at that time be careful.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4167 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-panorama-4-1024x423.jpg" alt="aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-panorama-4" width="1024" height="423" data-id="4167" />

Next to the onsen/sauna the locals have built a stove that harnesses the volcanic steam to bake your foods. We cooked eggs, potatoes, and our fish in the "oven" and they tasted delicious! We also grilled some yakatori and sausage too back at camp. We ate like kings that night.

The next day we explored the islands many sites and spectacular vistas of which my photos hardly do justice.

The island has a small network of roads, many of which have fallen into the ocean a long time ago.

[gallery columns="2" size="full" type="carousel" link="file" caption="default" masonry="default" width="" height="" ids="4174,4175,4176"]

We felt so blessed to visit the island during such great weather. During the day it was windy (which helped us deal with the humidity) and the sun was shining. At night you could see a million stars. Aogoshima is known for three things - its salt, the shochu, and star gazing. All of which we sampled and thoroughly enjoyed..

<img class="size-large wp-image-4177 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-panorama-3-1024x379.jpg" alt="aogashima-izu-islands-tokyo-prefecture-philippine-sea-volcano-panorama-3" width="1024" height="379" data-id="4177" />

[gallery columns="2" size="full" type="carousel" link="file" caption="default" masonry="default" width="" height="" ids="4178,4179,4181"]

On the day we were supposed to head back to Hachijojima to catch our flight home there was a 20-30% chance that the seas would be too rough for the ferry to land. With the fast approaching swells from yet another typhoon we would possibly be stuck on the island for another week! Thank God the ferry was able to land and we were able to get off the island. Not that we didn't thoroughly enjoy our time on the island we just were not adequately prepared to weather a typhoon, in our three season tent, on a tiny island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The city of <a href="http://104.248.67.90/nikko/" target="_blank">Nikko</a>, located in Tochigi Prefecture, is quite popular with tourists. I had visited a few months ago and had a great time visiting the Nikko Tosho-gu and Futarasanjinja - but the natural beauty of Nikko was the real draw for me. The Yutaki waterfall, Ryuzu waterfall, Senjogahara wetlands, Lake Chuzenji, and Yuno Lake were absolutely beautiful and considerably less crowded (the way I like it) then Nikko city proper. Still one trip wasn't enough and I resolved to visit the region again for some more in-depth exploration. Well that opportunity arose when <a href="https://tenkaraguides.com/guides/" target="_blank">John Vetterli</a> from <a href="https://tenkaraguides.com" target="_blank">Tenkara Guides LLC</a> emailed me about Greg from Colorado who was traveling to Japan and wanted to squeeze in a day of Tenkara between business meetings. Fortunately, I was able to fit him into my schedule the day before I needed to be in Tadami in the Aizu Region of Fukushima Prefecture. So we planned to meet in Nikko National Park for a day of exploring and Tenkara since it was on the way to Tadami.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4205 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/nikko-national-park-tochigi-prefecture-tenkara-iwana-yamame-kebari-fly-fishing-nice-day-1024x768.jpg" alt="nikko-national-park-tochigi-prefecture-tenkara-iwana-yamame-kebari-fly-fishing-nice-day" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4205" />

I drove up to Nikko National Park the day before both to do some scouting and to beat the Silver Week crowded highways. I arrived in the late afternoon and was able to get in a bit of fishing. One thing I quickly discovered was that the pressure was high on the streams within Nikko National Park. Still there were a decent amount of fish in the rivers, you just had to bring your A game to catch them. The streams also tended to be low gradient, which meant that there were long stretches of flat water that typically don't hold fish (at least this late in the season). That night I camped out in my <a href="http://104.248.67.90/custom-camper-microvan/" target="_blank">Kei van</a> at the <a href="https://www.michi-no-eki.jp/michinoeki/tochigi/yunishigawa/?language=1" target="_blank">Yunishigawa</a> <a href="http://104.248.67.90/michi-no-eki/" target="_blank">Michi-No-Eki</a> deep in the Nikko National Park. The place was nearly deserted, there was only one other group staying that night - a very sweet couple from Switzerland Anook and Freddie. We talked about Japan and our various adventures for quite awhile before we both crawled into our kitted out camper vans for the night.

The next morning I did a bit more scouting, then headed down to Kawajiyumoto Station to pick up Greg. The drive to the river from Kawajiyumoto station only took about 20 minutes and under a hazy blue sky we plunged into the frigid keiryu and began working our way upstream.

The river was mainly inhabited by Iwana, and we did see some big ones, but Iwana can be a very elusive. They have about 7° blind spot out of each eye, which is directly behind them. They are also very sensitive to shadows, colors, and movement. With a 350° range of view, you have to sneak up directly behind them. In small keiryu and genryu this is easier but in mid-sized to big rivers it can prove difficult. Wearing natural colors, staying low, and moving very stealthily when approaching a possible fish holding spot are all good techniques. Also being able to cast accurately with long lines and not laying a lot of line in the water is crucial. Still, even when you employ all these techniques flawlessly you still need a healthy dose of luck. Throughout the day we spotted close to two dozen fish but only brought one to hand.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4223 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/nikko-national-park-tochigi-prefecture-tenkara-iwana-yamame-kebari-fly-fishing-fish-on-1024x768.jpg" alt="nikko-national-park-tochigi-prefecture-tenkara-iwana-yamame-kebari-fly-fishing-fish-on" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4223" />

But fishing isn't just about the fish, it is also about the places you go and the people you go with. The river valley was gorgeous and we saw no signs of recent passage. The water, which flows from Miyoriyama, was cold, clear, and deep - despite a dryer than normal summer. Throughout Nikko National Park the lakes were very low and some streams had been reduced to a trickle as Greg and I found out when we decided to try our luck in a few other rivers. The time came to quickly for Greg to leave. I dropped him off at the train station and after a quick stop to soak my feet in a foot onsen I hit the road my destination - the Aizu Region of Fukushima Prefecture.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After spending a few days in Nikko National Park, I was ready to leave the Silver Week crowds behind and find some solitude. So I hit the road. My destination? Tadami, a small city in western Fukushima Prefecture. I had been invited by <a href="https://www.tenkara-fisher.com/search/label/Adam%20Trahanm/content.php?234-Adam-Trahan-(about-me)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Trahan</a> to join him and <a href="https://rockandriffle.blogspot.jp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Klags</a> along with a large group of Japanese Tenkara anglers for two days in the 250+ year old Kanozu Guard House (叶津番所) . I had never met any of them before and I was excited to put some faces to names and to hopefully make some new friends too. The drive from Nikko National Park into Aizu, which is the westernmost region of Fukushima Prefecture, was pleasant with a lot of rivers to distract me from my goal of making it to the <a href="https://www.michi-no-eki.jp/michinoeki/fukushima/kirara-289/?language=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kirara 289 Michi-No-Eki</a> by nightfall. When I finally pulled into the Michi-No-Eki I found the parking lot nearly filled with campers, vans, and motorcycles. Thankfully I got a spot and after a short walk to the <a href="https://www.kanko-aizu.com/kau/399/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello Shop</a> convenience store for some supplies I settled in for the night making ramen on my camp stove and enjoying the sound of the river flowing next to my van. That night as I slept the skies opened up and it rained hard the whole night.

[caption id="attachment_4231" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4231 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/aizu-fukushima-prefecture-tenkara-keiryu-kei-car-1024x768.jpg" alt="aizu-fukushima-prefecture-tenkara-keiryu-kei-car" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4231" /> Somewhere in Aizu[/caption]

The next morning my excitement awoke me early. There was a valley below Mt. Taishaku (帝釈山) from which emanated a promising looking river system. I had found this area on a cartoon map hanging on the wall in the Michi-No-Eki the night before. I was itching for an adventure and this had the makings of one written all over it. After about an hour of driving I turned off the main "highway" onto a side road that quickly turned to dirt. As I continued deeper into the valley I came across car after car parked on the side of the road. They were all anglers. I was dismayed, this much pressure surely meant that the fishing would be challenging. But I had driven this far I was not going to be deterred. I found an empty turn out, donned my <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/sawanobori-stream-climbing-shoes/">sawanobori</a> and rain gear, and plunged into woods towards the cacophony of the river. When I arrived I noticed that the water was a tannin brown tint. The rain from last night had obviously caused some flooding. A little discouraged I deployed my rod and began fishing the spots where I thought the fish might be holding while they waited for the flood waters to subside. After a few minutes I caught sight of two Tenkara anglers up river from me, so I put my rod away and ducked into the woods aiming for a nearby tributary in hopes of finding some fish and solitude.

[caption id="attachment_4232" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4232 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/aizu-fukushima-prefecture-tenkara-keiryu-weir-e1474875802964-1024x768.jpg" alt="aizu-fukushima-prefecture-tenkara-keiryu-weir" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4232" /> The rain really picked up when I arrived so I didn't get too many photos... This is a photo of the river on the way out. Definitely some big water.[/caption]

The tributary looked very promising and it was running very very cold and clear. I fished a good length of it but didn't see a single fish or get one bite. I turned around when my rain jacket soaked through and I began to shiver in the 15°C temps. Back at the van and not quite ready to give up, I doubled back to a stream I had passed on the way in and fished the lower section. I was hopeful that this section would have been skipped by those heading deeper into the mountains. My intuition proved fruitful and I got three strong bites, saw several fish, and even managed to bring one to hand too!

[caption id="attachment_4235" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4235 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/aizu-fukushima-prefecture-tenkara-keiryu-iwana-1024x768.jpg" alt="aizu-fukushima-prefecture-tenkara-keiryu-iwana" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4235" /> I'm pretty sure the native Iwana are the ones with big tails. The stocked fish don't need such powerful appendages in the ponds where they grow up. I released this guy.[/caption]

By now my clothes were completely soaked and my body, which was accustomed to the summer heat, was turning blue from the cold rain and the frigid keiryu... So I returned to my van, donned some dry clothes, and gorged myself on snacks before making my way back to civilization. Back on the road I made good time to Tadami and arrived several hours before everyone was scheduled to arrive. With some time to kill I decided to visit a river I'd dreamed of fishing for awhile. The road into the area was epic (and I've driven a lot of roads in Japan - this one was extra spicy). Once I found a spot to park, figuring out how to get to the river proved to be very complicated. I finally resorted in falling down a cliff to get to the bottom (thank God there was a random tree that broke my fall, or else it would have been bad). Like the river early that day this river also had a tannin brown tinge which made finding fish interested in eating a lot of work. I found one. Still I had dreamed of fishing <a href="https://www.fishingvision.ch/media/tenkara-%22dou%22-with-yuzo-sebata-%5Btrailer%5D/50525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> river ever since I'd seen it on video, and the fact alone that I was there made it super special. Even if I only got one bite and scared the living sh*# out of myself, it was besides the point. If the fall into the canyon was scary the climb out was on a whole other level - surrounded by roaring waterfalls and rotten vines the ascent back to the "road" was harrowing.

After three days of living in my van and fishing, I was starting to smell like a <a href="https://tenkaratanuki.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tanuki</a>. So before I made my to the bansho (aka Kanozu Guard House (叶津番所)) I stopped by a river next to a large rice field and took a bath with some soap. When I arrived at the bansho there were two tour busses parked out front but I braved the crowds and soon enough I spotted Sebata-san sitting at a table surrounded by a group of laughing Japanese men. I introduced myself and listened in to the conversation which had something to do with level line, kebari presentation, and Sebata-san's furled line (and it's obvious merits above level line). It was a conversation that made me really wish that my Japanese was better. Soon enough Adam-san (Trahan) and Adam-chan (Klags) showed up with <span class="fwn fcg"><span class="fwb fcg" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;;&quot;}">Go Ishii, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Akebikun.keiji.ito.12?hc_ref=NEWSFEED&amp;fref=nf">Keiji Ito</a>, &amp; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/keiichi.okushi">Keiichi Okushi</a>. There were so many great folks in attendance that night - all under the roof of a building almost as old as the United States and at a table over flowing with a smorgasbord of delicious Japanese foods. It didn't seem real.</span></span>

<img class="size-large wp-image-4310 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/aizu-fukushima-prefecture-tenkara-keiryu-takizawa-adam-trahan-resize-1024x767.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="767" data-id="4310" />

Adam Trahan put together a very good report of the whole evening (plus the adventure before too that you shouldn't miss). I won't try and compete - rather I'll just share a few of my photos, encourage you to come to the Land of the Rising Sun yourself, and leave a link to Adam's post <a href="https://www.tenkara-fisher.com/2017/01/genryu-fishing-of-japan-32.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

The next morning the rain was still coming down and I abandoned any hope of squeezing in a quick Tenkara session before heading home. Instead I got a much better offer - visit Yamano-san's "Luxury Kazusao Yamano fishing tackle shop" (高級和竿 山野釣具店) in Saitama, Tokyo. He wanted to teach me how to make a bamboo rod, I emphatically agreed. After packing up I began saying good bye to everyone, I showed Sebata-san my sugegasa and told him that I was emulating him. He laughed and ducked into a back room with my sugegasa. He returned a short while later having loaded my fly patch, on the inside brim, with several of his hand tied kebari!! I haven't decided yet if I will fish with them or save them for posterity. A gift like that is something very special.

The good byes were strangely difficult as I had only known the group for less than 24 hours. But I felt a strong kindred spirit between all of us. Despite varying backgrounds, language, religions, politics, and beliefs we were bonded together by the same passion. A passion that could be defined as Tenkara but it goes so much deeper than just that one word. For me this trip had been about immersing myself in a glorious natural world, enjoying the gifts given to me, expressing them through my meager talents, and then sharing them with a group of like minded individuals all struggling to put into words the majesty of the past few days spent in the keiryu of Japan.

<hr />

<img class="size-large wp-image-4270 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/genryu-tenkara-keiryu-oze-national-park-japan-kebari-1024x768.jpg" alt="genryu-tenkara-keiryu-oze-national-park-japan-kebari" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4270" />

You can find Genryu (it is pronounced <strong>g-en</strong> [as in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ken</span> but with a 'G' or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Again</span> without the 'A'] <b>roo</b>) pretty much anywhere there is a mountain in Japan (Japan is 80% mountains so there are a lot of genryu). Unfortunately they are some of the more threatened waterways in the <em>'Land of the Rising Sun'</em>. A lot of the genryu tend to be overfished and consequently there just aren't very many, if any fish left. A general rule of thumb in Japan is that if the fish is longer than 15cm (a length typically achieved in one season of growth) you can take it home. A good sign you are fishing a heavily pressured genryu is if all the fish are tiny. This is because none of the fish live through a season. The biggest threat by far though is the Japanese affinity for dams. There are over <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/blog/2015/06/damnation-help-stop-ishiki-dam-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100,000 dams</a> in Japan and it has really hurt the fish populations, especially in the genryu. So while there are genryu all over Japan finding ones that have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> been decimated by the lack of a catch and release culture and dams can be challenging.

I had a great conversation with Go-Ishii about this during my visit to <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/exploring-aizu-interior-fukushima-prefecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aizu</a>. One thing he told me that I found very encouraging was that foreigners (those who are not Japanese citizens of Japanese ancestry) have a real opportunity to fast track a revolution in how the Japanese view fish, angling, and proper land stewardship. It seems hardly a week goes by that I do not get an email, read an article, or watch a video about how dams are being torn down, river habitat restored, and native fish are being reintroduced into areas throughout the United States of America (and Britain too). While there is a lot of work left to do and a lot of battles to still be fought, it is encouraging to see a nation waking up to the realities of how several centuries of un-checked greed has damaged their precious resources. If this attitude of protecting the land and its natural inhabitants is just getting on its feet in the "west" it has barely been conceived in Japan.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4304 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/genryu-tenkara-keiryu-oze-national-park-japan-kebari-friends-1024x768.jpg" alt="genryu-tenkara-keiryu-oze-national-park-japan-kebari-friends" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4304" />

In my article "<a href="https://issuu.com/troutrageous1/docs/tenkaraanglerpremiumfall2016.issuu/c/smtdqwm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conversing In Japanese</a>" which was featured in the Fall 2016 issue of <a href="https://tenkaraangler.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tenkara Angler</a>, I said that I <em>"<span style="font-weight: 400;">believe[d] that every Tenkara angler should make a pilgrimage to Japan not just for the fishing but to immerse themselves in another culture. Too many of the problems currently facing the “west” today, could be easily resolved with a little perspective, grace, and respect. Something that Japan, its people, and its culture can offer in spades." </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is definitely something we can learn from visiting (or even better living for awhile in) Japan there is also something we as anglers can teach them. Namely the merits of catch and release (along with proper handling of fish during the release process) and how to be good stewards of the land through habitat restoration and realizing the consequences of the unchecked construction of dams, bridges, tunnels, and roads.</span>

Now just so you know, there are a lot of genryu with plenty of fish near heavily populated areas like the Kanto Plain (where Tokyo resides), you just have to be up for an adventure to get there. If the access is easy, then the area will most likely see a lot of angling pressure (isn't this true though on every continent?). So strap on a pair of <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/sawanobori-stream-climbing-shoes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sawanobori</a> shoes, throw a <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/blue-white-flycatcher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rope</a> in your pack, and be prepared for some <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/nihon-kawanezumi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">excitement</a>.

Case in point - my latest (and the last proper genryu) trip for the 2016 Tenkara season was an absolute blast and the genryu was LOADED with Iwana.

My alarm's screeching startled me from a pleasant dream. To fully cement my wakefulness my wife groaned and gave me a sleepy shove, she still had a few hours to sleep before it was time for her to get up and go to work. I stumbled out of bed, flipped on the coffee maker, and climbed into the shower (there is no better way to wake up before the sun than a shower). Soon enough I found myself behind the wheel of my friends Subaru XV on a Japanese toll-road, the sun cresting over the horizon forcing me to don my sunglasses. It was a beautiful morning and the days prospects were prominent in my mind as we discussed all manner of subjects between our second languages. Soon enough we were struggling beneath our 50lb packs up an old dirt road deep in the mountains of <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/oze-national-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oze National Park</a>. About half way into our hike we stopped to rehydrate and replenish our energy reserves on Asahi beer and chiruoshi (さるなし) aka hardy kiwis.

After our break, the ominous clouds finally delivered the contents that we hoped they would spare us.

It rained heavily for the next several hours. The rain was just a continuation of an exceptionally wet month. All hopes of having a campfire that night were extinguished by each plump rain drop that fell from the grey sky... but that did not stop us from trying anyways.

Our campsite was one of dreams. We were on the edge of a meadow a babbling brook cascading down a hillside covered in bamboo and a river not more than 10' away with a thousand happy Iwana swimming in its depths

<strong>The rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower, bread for the eater, 'and fish for the angler'.</strong>

<img class="size-large wp-image-4301 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/genryu-tenkara-keiryu-oze-national-park-japan-kebari-waterfall-768x1024.jpg" alt="genryu-tenkara-keiryu-oze-national-park-japan-kebari-waterfall" width="768" height="1024" data-id="4301" />

Over the next three days I brought to hand over 30 Iwana with another 20 or so that gave chase to my fly or got off before I could properly "catch" them. It was by far one of the best (if not the best days) of fishing I've had in Japan. There wasn't a dam in site (except at the end of the third day when we were fishing closer to 'civilization') and we did not see any people until the hike out (and they were biologist maintaining/monitoring deer migration routes).

The second night the rain subsided and a million stars glistened through the leaves that were dancing in the intermittent breeze. As the night drew on, the temperatures dropped to nearly freezing! As I shivered in my 0° C rated bag I reminded myself to remember the day when I was cold and needed a beanie and a jacket. After a long warm summer the first cold days are a God send.

The third day we packed up camp and headed back to the car but not before making a short detour to fish a promising tributary that yielded another dozen fish and a handful or two of yamabudo (山ぶどう) aka mountain grapes.

The genryu of Japan are absolutely beautiful and totally unique, anyone that has fished one knows it. They offer a fishing experience that is hard, if not impossible, to replicate anywhere else in the world. If you haven't already you would be remiss not to make plans right now to visit next season - early April through late June are the best months. If you come early enough you can catch the cherry blossoms and make sure you have some soba, sashimi, and ramen too. This country is something you should experience at least once in your life.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month I travelled to the <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/exploring-aizu-interior-fukushima-prefecture/" target="_blank">Aizu Region</a> of <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/grandeco-ski-resort/" target="_blank">Fukushima Prefecture</a> and met up with some of the preeminent Japanese and American Tenkara ambassadors for a social gathering, in a building older than the United States. During this event I was invited by Masayuki Yamano-san to go ハゼ fishing with him the following month. Yamano-san owns a speciality rod shop in Saitama, Tokyo where he practices the ancient Japanese art form of <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/tosaku/" target="_blank">Kazusao (和竿)</a> or hand making bamboo fishing rods. I immediately accepted his invitation despite knowing next to nothing about ハゼ or the fishing style.

[caption id="attachment_4330" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4330 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/goby-fishing-edogawa-tokyo-brackish-boat-1024x768.jpg" alt="goby-fishing-edogawa-tokyo-brackish-boat" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4330" /> The crew hard at Goby fishing![/caption]

In Japan Goby fish are called Haze ハゼ (pronounced ha-zay) and despite their small size they are a very popular game fish. Most Goby aka ハゼ are 5-10cm long but they they can grow much bigger during the spawning season - it just isn't very common. Gobies ハゼ habitat is found in shallow brackish water with sandy and muddy sea bottoms, which is pretty common around Tokyo. Goby ハゼ season starts around June but they are more difficult to catch then due to their very small size. Starting mid-July through October the fish stature increases and they become much easier to catch using bait. In fact they are so easy to catch that the record for the most caught in a single day is 1,500!

[caption id="attachment_4348" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4348 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/goby-fishing-edogawa-tokyo-brackish-gobi-1024x768.jpg" alt="goby-fishing-edogawa-tokyo-brackish-gobi" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4348" /> About five minutes into the morning! Goby really are easy to catch.[/caption]
<p style="text-align: left;">Fast forward to the pre-determined date in October and I awoke before the sun to catch the first train out of Yokosuka. My destination was Myoden Station in Edogawa Tokyo. Some two hours later I arrived and jumped in my friend Go Ishii-san's car for the quick drive to the Edogawa River and the docks where our charter <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/AF2Zh9gE1Cn" target="_blank">Itoyusen</a>, operates from. We met the crew at the pier and after stocking up on some last minute beer from the vending machine we boarded our boat. A few minutes later the boat captain anchored us in the river and we began rigging our lines. The water was only about 1.5-2 meters deep. Since Goby prefer to feed on the bottom you fish with a fixed line about 60cm longer than the water depth and a heavy weight attached near the hook. For bait we used worms and scallops.</p>
[gallery link="file" type="carousel" caption="default" masonry="default" width="" height="" columns="2" size="full" ids="4336,4337,4338,4339,4340,4341,4335"]

Goby are very easy to catch. I probably caught somewhere around 20 fish and I was more focussed on talking and hanging out than fishing. For every 50 bites or so I would succeed in catching a Gobi, they are quite adept at cleaning ones hook without getting caught. About halfway through the day Yamano-san let me borrow one of his bamboo ハゼ rods. I was very impressed at not only the exquisite craftsmanship but how sensitive yet firm the rod was. I could feel every little bite so much more clearly than with my Tenkara rod. The rod felt very supple and soft yet when I set the hook it felt like a stiffer rod. It is kind of hard to explain, it is something that must be felt to be believed. I cannot wait to start making my own bamboo rod next month!

[caption id="attachment_4350" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4350 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/goby-fishing-edogawa-tokyo-brackish-bamboo-rod-lesson-1024x768.jpg" alt="goby-fishing-edogawa-tokyo-brackish-bamboo-rod-lesson" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4350" /> Getting a lesson from Go Ishii-san and Oreo-san on how to use Yamano-san's bamboo ハゼ rod[/caption]

After five hours of fishing we summoned the boat captain from shore and returned to the pier. On the way back Ishii-san and I dumped our bucket with about 75 fish in it back into the river. We already had plenty of fish for everyone and Goby aren't the easiest to clean (they're small and slippery factor in a bit too much to drink and a moving boat and it was a miracle no one lost a finger)

There was a nice park next to the river and in no time flat we had a full on BBQ going with pig intestines, some sort of sausage made from the fat of a cows placenta, and Goby tempura (oh and a few liters of beer too). It was all delicious, I am very much hooked on Japanese stream side BBQ now :)

[gallery columns="2" size="full" type="carousel" ids="4344,4345,4346,4347" link="file" caption="default" masonry="default" width="" height=""]

After eating all the BBQ we packed up and headed down to a local restaurant where we continued the party for another couple of hours. It was a great way to wrap up a wonderful day hanging out with friends, making new ones, and trying soba water sochi (which is quite delicious). Unfortunately with a two hour train ride to get home I had to say goodbye too soon, but I am looking forward to my next fishing outing with Yamano-san and his illustrious crew!<img class="size-large wp-image-4351 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/goby-fishing-edogawa-tokyo-brackish-post-fishing-photo-op-1024x1024.jpg" alt="goby-fishing-edogawa-tokyo-brackish-post-fishing-photo-op" width="1024" height="1024" data-id="4351" />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ayu are a highly sought after game fish in Japan, some of the best rivers in Japan that they call home are highly revered. 30-40 years ago, before Japan began making dams at a breakneck speed - Ayu would swim up the rivers from the ocean, much like salmon or steelhead. Now a days Ayu are mostly stocked but you can still find them in rivers close to the ocean, below the impassable barriers that have sprung up in the rivers they have called home for centuries. Izu Peninsula is one of these places (especially on the Suruga Bay side) where Ayu can still swim pretty far upstream from the ocean. These rivers are also inhabited by sea run Amago, which are quite fun to catch with a Tenkara rod. <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/amago/">Last year</a> I traveled to this paradise of striking sea cliffs, white sandy beaches, trout streams, and warm water and caught my first two Amago! This year Kado-san and I returned for three days and two nights to see if we could find a few more Amago.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4379 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/izu-peninsula-ayu-tenkara-amago-fly-fishing-japan-ayu-1024x595.jpg" alt="izu-peninsula-ayu-tenkara-amago-fly-fishing-japan-ayu" width="1024" height="595" data-id="4379" /> Not my photo courtesy of ©Wikipedia-Japan[/caption]

The morning of day one started early but within a few hours we were parked near the first river which was nestled in a beautiful valley surrounded by citrus trees. It was nearly time for the harvest and the air was filled with the scent of tangerines, oranges, and lemons. After a few hours of fishing, we came across two Amago fighting (or maybe rough spawning...?) in a nice pool. We watched them splash in the water for awhile and then turned around and headed back to the <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/japanese-kei-cars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">van</a> and drove to our usual camping spot.

[gallery columns="2" size="full" type="carousel" link="file" caption="default" masonry="default" width="" height="" ids="4380,4381,4382,4383,4384,4385,4386,4396"]

We setup camp and after soaking in the hot sun for awhile I went for a swim in the crystal clear bay next to our free campsite. When I got back to camp a local was talking to Kado-san, his name was Ma-chan (short for Matsumoto). After chatting for a while he disappeared only to return shortly with a few cold beers and some sashimi. A few hours later we followed Ma-chan to a "secret" locals only pool in the keiryu that flowed through the village. Ma-chan handed me a spear and goggles and pointed me towards the water. Within a few minutes I had speared two Ayu! Besides being freezing from swimming in the cold keiryu I was pretty excited to have gotten two fish my first time using a spear. We cooked up the Ayu at Ma-chan's house and then stopped in at the locals only onsen for a nice soak.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4387 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/izu-peninsula-ayu-tenkara-amago-fly-fishing-japan-panorama-1024x377.jpg" alt="izu-peninsula-ayu-tenkara-amago-fly-fishing-japan-panorama" width="1024" height="377" data-id="4387" />

The next day we fished two rivers, including the one right next to our beachside campsite. Unfortunately we didn't catch any fish nor see any Amago (I did see a TON of Ayu though). It was such a beautiful day and I was so happy to be fishing with my Tenkara rod again that it didn't matter.

[caption id="attachment_4398" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4398 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/izu-peninsula-ayu-tenkara-amago-fly-fishing-japan-ayu-food-1024x768.jpg" alt="izu-peninsula-ayu-tenkara-amago-fly-fishing-japan-ayu-food" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4398" /> Signs of Ayu feeding on algae were prevalent[/caption]

While we were fishing though Kado-san came across two fresh water crabs that we brought back to camp with us. So we weren't completely skunked. We steamed the crabs in some wine while the camp fire crackled in the evening's dark sky dotted with glistening stars. It was a magical evening.

The next day we packed up camp, said goodbye to Ma-chan, and headed south for lunch at a famous Unagi restaurant. After lunch we stopped by a free outdoor onsen. Unfortunately, the water was WAY to hot for me to even bear for a second so we hit the road and began making our way home, but not before we stopped to visit of a few of Kado-san's friend who owned a potato farm near Ito.

After a quick visit we got back on the road, we had one more stop to make. Kado-san had a friend who is a bamboo rod maker. He lived in Atami, which was on the way home for us, and he wanted to introduce me and show me his workshop...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Herabuna are a sub-species of Carp that are a very popular game fish in Japan. The style of fishing for Herabuna is the antithesis of Tenkara. While both utilize a fixed line fishing method with rods that breakdown or collapse that is about where the similarities end. Herabuna fishing utilizes bait, is primarily catch and release (due to the taste of the fish), and requires hours of patiently sitting (literally) in one spot. Herabuna rods come in all lengths and cover the full gambit of the flex scale. The stiffer Herabuna rods are similar to a softish Tenkara rod. Some Japanese websites that I have visited even suggest that Herabuna rods can be used to catch <a href="https://www.allfishingbuy.com/All-About-Hera-Fishing.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all</a> manner of fish with both bait and flies. This is an interesting hypothesis that I would like to explore more of. I am a now a huge fan of bamboo rods - and not just for their aesthetics but their ability to translate even the smallest bites into very perceptible tremors at the handle. A fact that I came to discover during my recent <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/goby-fishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haze</a> fishing trip where we were catching fish no bigger than 7.5cm.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4422 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/herabuna-bamboo-rod-maker-atami-izu-peninsula-fishing-rod-768x1024.jpg" alt="herabuna-bamboo-rod-maker-atami-izu-peninsula-fishing-rod" width="768" height="1024" data-id="4422" />

A few months ago I met with <a href="https://www.tenkarausa.com/myportfolio/conversations-japan-with-adam-trahan-and-adam-klags/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam-san and Adam-chan</a> as well as a large group of Tenkara anglers in the Aizu region of Fukushima Prefecture (if you haven't read my trip report please check it out <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/exploring-aizu-interior-fukushima-prefecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). During that trip I got to know a lot of big names in the Japanese Tenkara community, one of which is Yamano-san. Yamano-san makes beautiful bamboo fishing rods. While I was in Aizu Yamano-san offered to teach me the art of <a href="https://craftsmanship.net/bamboo-take-two-japans-gorgeous-precarious-fishing-poles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Edo-Wazao</em></a> and so next month I will start studying under his tutelage the art of making bamboo fishing rods! Needless to say I was very excited when my friend Kado-san offered to introduce me to Hajime Murai (竿姫) a Herabuna bamboo rod maker living in Atami. Atami is located on the Sagami Bay side of Izu Peninsula very close to where we had spent <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/ayu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three days camping and Tenkara fishing</a> on the peninsula. So it was very convenient to stop in and visit Murai-san's shop/residence on the way home. Not to mention I was eager to learn more about <em>Edo-Wazao</em>.

[caption id="attachment_4424" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4424 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/herabuna-bamboo-rod-maker-atami-izu-peninsula-hajime-murai-1024x768.jpg" alt="herabuna-bamboo-rod-maker-atami-izu-peninsula-hajime-murai" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4424" /> Hajime Murai (竿姫) in his wood shop[/caption]

We spent several hours chatting discussing all manner of subjects. Hajime Murai (竿姫) has an impressive collection of hand tied flies as well as hand carved lures. In fact he was heavily promoting fishing with one of his wooden lures and a fly attached together. Murai-san is an avid western fly fisherman (aka with a reel) and likes to use both a lure and a fly when he fishes. It is a technique he swears by.

[caption id="attachment_4425" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4425 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/herabuna-bamboo-rod-maker-atami-izu-peninsula-tamo-1024x768.jpg" alt="herabuna-bamboo-rod-maker-atami-izu-peninsula-tamo" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4425" /> Hajime Murai (竿姫) hand carves some very exquisite Tamo fishing nets![/caption]

[gallery columns="2" size="full" type="carousel" link="file" caption="default" masonry="default" width="" height="" ids="4426,4427,4428,4429,4430,4431"]

While we were chatting Murai-san and Kado-san were pulling hundreds of bamboo fishing rods out of storage and going through them one by one. When I asked Kado-san what they were looking for he told me that Murai-san wanted to give me a rod that was stiff enough to be used as a Tenkara rod! I was very honored and a little taken aback by such a generous gift (not to mention he had already given me a bamboo Tamo. It wasn't finished though so he told me to come back in the spring and he would have it finished for me). I ended up leaving that evening with two Herabuna bamboo fishing rods that Murai-san had made in 1980!!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[November is a beautiful month in Japan - the fall colors are in full swing, the days are cool the evenings are brisk, and preparations are in full swing for snow. However, the lull between Tenkara season and ski season requires that I get creative to find things to do. Luckily, there is a seemingly endless plethora of outdoor activities to enjoy in Japan.

<h4>Wakasagi Fishing on Lake Sagamiko</h4>
Wakasagi also known as Smelt is a very popular game fish in Japan. Even though these fish are only a few inches long Wakasagi anglers really get into it with some impressive gear.

The Fall colors are amazing this year and Toyohide Waterfall was raging from all the rain.

I have also been busy with some guest writing on <a href="https://www.discovertenkara.co.uk/blog/blog-31.html" target="_blank">Discover Tenkara</a> and <a href="https://tenkaratalk.com/2016/11/guest-post-kado-sans-christmas-kebari/" target="_blank">Tenkara Talk</a> - it has been a <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/about/recent-press/" target="_blank">busy</a> month.

I also squeezed in a trip to <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/fishing-uratanzawa/" target="_blank">Uratanzawa</a> where the Rainbow are getting huge! I brought one to hand but the camera was in the car. The rest broke the 5x tippet like it was thread.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The craftsmanship of Japanese artisans is extraordinary - a fact known to many but one that has become more apparent to me through first hand experience. Last month, <a href="https://www.discovertenkara.co.uk" target="_blank">Discover Tenkara</a> featured my article about Yamano-san, and his <a href="https://www.discovertenkara.co.uk/blog/blog-31.html" target="_blank">bamboo</a> fishing rod craftsmanship. Then a few weeks later Jason Klass at <a href="https://tenkaratalk.com" target="_blank">Tenkara Talk</a> featured my article "<a href="https://tenkaratalk.com/2016/11/guest-post-kado-sans-christmas-kebari/" target="_blank">Kado-san's Christmas Kebari</a>" about Kado-san's shokuryosha like kebari.

So in the same vein of Japanese craftsmanship, I am sharing some more exquisite Japanese craftsmanship that I've discovered recently.

<center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMtSc2MJLcw?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><em>Miya Shoji, Japanese carpenter transplanted to New York City to perfect his carpentry. It's a fascinating video and well worth watching imo.</em>

<hr />

<h5>Hitoshi Kondo-san</h5>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4509 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/HItoshi-Kondo-bamboo-craft-artisan-wakasagi-1024x768.jpg" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4509" /> Hitoshi Kondo-san is second from the left (holding the white plastic bag).[/caption]

I met Kondo-san on a Wakasagi fishing trip to Sagamiko last month. He struck me as very quiet and humble but at the end of the day we ended up taking the same train and I got to know him better. He lives north of Tokyo near Kamikawa, where he lives a simple life so that he can focus on his passion - Japanese bamboo basket making. He has dedicated his life to making some absolutely beautiful baskets. He claims that he is still learning but to me his baskets don't look like they can get any better!

<img class="size-large wp-image-4510 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/HItoshi-Kondo-bamboo-craft-artisan-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4510" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-4511 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/HItoshi-Kondo-bamboo-baskets-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4511" />

<hr />

<h5>Toshiaka Kado-san</h5>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<img class="wp-image-4512 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kadosan-stained-glass-craftmanship-artisan-768x1024.jpg" width="768" height="1024" data-id="4512" /> Kado-san displaying his artwork in front of his shop. He also made the stained glass panels behind him.[/caption]

Kado-san has become a very good friend of mine but he is also a man of many secrets. I knew him for over a year before I found out he makes stained glass. His artwork is displayed throughout his <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/kadoya-outdoor-shop/" target="_blank">store</a> located not to far from my home.

[caption id="attachment_4515" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4515 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kadosan-stained-glass-craftmanship-trout-bros-1024x768.jpg" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4515" /> His glasswork shop also doubles as his fly tying station.[/caption]

When my wife and I eventually return to the United States we are looking forward to incorporating his beautiful stained glass into the tiny home we hope to build for our growing family. Not only will the beauty inspire us everyday but it will remind us of the wonderful experiences we had when we lived in the Land of the Rising Sun...

<a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/herabuna/" target="_blank">Every time</a> I hold a piece of Japanese craftsmanship, whether it be a hand carved wooden pen from a <a href="https://taiken.co/single/tsumago-magome-post-towns-in-nagano" target="_blank">Post Town</a> or even a bamboo bait fishing basket, I am drawn to the attention to detail and pride the worker exhibits in their craft. The self-respect, patience, and skill that they exhibit in their work is certainly a breath of fresh air. Some things never change or go out of style, and for that I am grateful.

		<title>Finishing My Bamboo Tenkara Rod (and Some Phenomenal Skiing)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few weeks ago I wrote a guest article for <a href="https://www.discovertenkara.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discover Tenkara</a> about the bamboo rod Go Ishii and I have been making under the supervision of <a href="https://saosyosaku.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yamano-san</a>. If you missed the article you can check it out <a href="https://www.discovertenkara.co.uk/blog/blog-31.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Well this past week I travelled back up to Kawaguchi with Go Ishii-san, and together we put the finishing touches on our bamboo rods!

[caption id="attachment_4538" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4538 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tenkara-sao-kawaguchi-tokyo-yamano-san-1024x768.jpg" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4538" /> Go Ishii-san testing out a bamboo rod that Yamano-san is custom making for him.[/caption]

In November we selected our bamboo, straightened the pieces, and wrapped the female ends with thread. This month we had to drill out the female ends, sand and file the male ends to make them fit snuggly, apply a few coats of lacquer to achieve a high gloss finish, and glue the handle to the rod.
[kadence_gallery id="4545"]

We finished all the steps before lunch and while we waited for the glue to dry we headed out for some food. I got the miso sesame ramen with gyoza and a beer to wash it all down. I have yet to meet a bowl of ramen I haven't loved in Japan. This ramen did not disappoint - it was absolutely delicious.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4547 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tenkara-sao-kawaguchi-tokyo-yamano-san-lunch-1024x768.jpg" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4547" /> Mmmm... I'm getting hungry just looking at this yummy ramen![/caption]

After lunch we headed to the Shibagawa (芝川) which is within walking distance of Yamano-san's home and shop to test out our rods. Go Ishii and Yamano-san's okusan (wife) caught the lion share of fish. Yamano-san spent most of the trip rigging lines for me as I wasn't catching anything. Just before I became a human popsicle I caught a Moshido (モツゴ) - she was a beautiful iridescent purple and pink with silver scales. I slipped her back into the murky water and we high tailed it back to the shop to warm up.
[kadence_gallery id="4549"]

Back at the shop Yamano-san's wife gave me my first Shodo (calligraphy) lesson! The first character I learned was Sao (竿) which is written using 9 strokes in a specific order. Ishii-san and I both wrote our names and the length of the rod in Japanese on the rod sleeves - then we went to dinner. Check out the video at the bottom of the page that Go-Ishii-san shot of me writing my first Japanese character.
<h5>てんから竿。ハ尺六寸。タイト。アイサシク</h5>

[caption id="attachment_4560" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4560 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tenkara-sao-kawaguchi-tokyo-yamano-san-dinner-1024x768.jpg" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4560" /> A delicious meal[/caption]

We went to a Nabemono restaurant but we were still pretty full from lunch, so we opted for a plethora of appetizers instead. That evening we dined on pig intestines, pig heart, pig stomach, a bowl of onions and fish flakes, a mountain of cabbage, pig liver, fish sausage deep fried, fried onigiri, and sake to wash it all down. It was <strong>all</strong> seriously good!

<h4>Skiing At Kagura Tashiro Ski Resort</h4>
In August I got a new pair of skis for my birthday - the ostentatious <a href="https://www.backcountry.com/black-crows-corvus-freebird-ski" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Crow Corvus Freebird</a>. They got very good reviews and I was excited to break them in. I mounted the acclaimed <a href="https://www.backcountry.com/marker-kingpin-10-at-binding?s=a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marker Kingpin AT</a> binding, which while a little heavy for an AT binding were supposed to cure the problems I had with my Dynafit bindings (namely pre-release in sketchy conditions). Well this week it absolutely dumped snow in Niigata Prefecture and so my friend Junpei and I headed out to Kagura Ski Resort. After a few hours lapping some fun in-bound runs we donned our skins and headed into the side-country. The upper part of the resort does not open until January 1st so we skied some closed in-bound runs. Afterwards, we dropped into a nice bowl for some tight skiing between yet to be buried bushes and trees. The powder was light, fluffy, and about knee to waist deep.
[kadence_gallery id="4564"]
My new skis and bindings performed as advertised, the heavier weight of the skis (when compared to my previous sticks - the Black Diamond Kilowatt) gave me a lot of confidence in the choppy surfaces you often find after a few days of continuous snow minus grooming. The bindings were very impressive, despite the -23°C temps they never iced up and the connection to my skis made me feel like I was skiing with an alpine binding! I am very happy with my new toys and I am looking forward to the many adventures we'll embark on together.

Here is a quick video I compiled of both my first Shodo (Japanese calligraphy) lesson and some footage from the Kagura Tashiro ski trip. I dedicated the run in the video to my late friend Sienna Caselle. She took her life this past April at the young age of 16. We both volunteered for an Adaptive Skiing non-profit called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/onewayoranotherinc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Two Top Mountain Adaptive</a>, which is where I met her and her father. During the winter she rode a snowboard and helped teach the wounded warriors and disabled athletes. She was always smiling, vibrant, spunky, and she always beat me down the mountain. During the summer she helped out with the water skiing events that the non-profit put on. She taught me how to ride a stand up Seadoo and showed me a really cool rope swing near Dam 4 on the Potomac. Her father started an adaptive non-profit in her memory called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/onewayoranotherinc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"One Way Or Another"</a>. In the Marine Corps I lost too many brothers during my deployments but suicide is particularly harsh and for someone so young too. Her passing has been a hard pill to swallow

It was a great run Sienna, the powder was blower and waist deep - I wish you could have been there.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[2016 was a great year with big trips every month of the fishing season and some phenomenal hikes, rock climbs, mountain bike rides, and of course skiing thrown in the mix too. Here are a few of the highlights.

<center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mctJCCG3xUw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>
The New Year was kicked off with the incomparable <a href="http://104.248.67.90/nozawa-onsen-fire-festival/" target="_blank">Nozawa Onsen Fire Festival</a>. What could possibly be more Japanese then turning a water theme park into a <a href="http://104.248.67.90/toshimaen-fishing-park/" target="_blank">fishing resort</a>? I kitted out my kei van with a <a href="http://104.248.67.90/custom-camper-microvan/" target="_blank">swank camper interior</a> that came in quite handy. My friend Junpei and I experienced true <a href="http://104.248.67.90/yugen/" target="_blank">yugen</a> during a fabulous ski trip to Akita and Iwate Prefectures. Probably my most favorite rock climbing crag in Japan has to be <a href="http://104.248.67.90/rock-climbing-ogawayama/" target="_blank">Ogawayama</a>, and for good reason! I introduced my good friend to Tenkara in the <a href="http://104.248.67.90/minakami-headwaters-tone-river/" target="_blank">headwaters</a> of the Tone River. Then a month later we visited the old stomping grounds of the shokurayosha beneath the shadow of the impressive <a href="http://104.248.67.90/torikabuto-nagano-prefecture/" target="_blank">Torikabutosan</a>. I discovered a fabulous fishing coop in my backyard at the <a href="http://104.248.67.90/tanitaro-river/" target="_blank">TaniTaro River</a>. I pursued the elusive <a href="http://104.248.67.90/blue-white-flycatcher/" target="_blank">Blue and White Flycatcher</a> deep in the Tanzawa Mountains and discovered an ultra-remote stream loaded with ghost Iwana. My wife and I explored Hachijojima and the seldom visited <a href="http://104.248.67.90/aogashima/" target="_blank">Aogashima</a> islands a few hundred kilometers off the coast of Japan. My good friend Kado-san and Wan-san and I finished of the fishing season with a bang by camping on the banks of a remote <a href="http://104.248.67.90/genryu-tenkara/" target="_blank">genryu</a> deep in Oze National Park. Last, and certainly not least, I had the distinct honor of learning how to make <a href="http://104.248.67.90/japanese-bamboo-tenkara-rod-skiing/" target="_blank">bamboo Tenkara rods</a> with Yamano-sensei and Ishii-san.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This past weekend the Japan Fishing Show was held in Yokohama at the Pacific Convention Center. A few days prior my friend Go Ishii-san messaged me and asked if I would like to attend. He said he needed some help getting footage for an upcoming episode of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TenkaraInFocus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tenkara In Focus </a>episode. He also knew I was in the market for a new Japanese tenkara rod - what better place could one ask for to shop around for a new Tenkara rod!? Obviously I accepted his invitation!

The day of the show dawned sunny and very cold. The conference center was only a 30 minute train ride from home and so in short order I was standing in the massive Pacific Convention Center surrounded by all manner of fishing paraphernalia! It was an anglers (of any bent) dream come true. There was gear everywhere - a massive forest of rods, decked out fishing vans, kayaks, SUPs, various regional tourist destination booths, a pond filled with Rainbow trout for the kids to fish in, a dance troupe, demos, give aways, and an epic food court!

[kadence_gallery id="4634"]

I got to play with a bunch of Tenkara rods from Shimano, Tenryu (that TF39TA sure is sexy!!), Daiwa, and Gamakatsu to name a few. There were even a few fly tiers from many regions of Japan offering not only trout flies but Ayu flies as well. Many of the fluorocarbon and nylon line manufacturers were on hand too. And of course I got to rub elbows with some famous anglers!

After the show the Sebatta-san gang went out for a delicious dinner - I had to duck out of the festivities a little early though due to newborn baby duties :)

<img class="size-full wp-image-4665 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/japan-fishing-show-yokohama-pacific-convention-center-sebatasan-gang.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="720" data-id="4665" />

Overall, it was an amazing experience made even better by the great company. You can look forward to a more in depth report from Tenkara In Focus coming soon!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Issac, I just noticed you have a picture with Mr. Hosoyama Chōji [細山長司さん]. I first became aware of him when someone posted, in 2010 I think, a link to him fishing in British Columbia. Which at the time some people confused with Tenkara fishing. I believe he passed away not long after the fishing show, in May 2017. But I did not know he was also a tenkara angler until I recently found an interview of him on the nepenthes website. He modified a hae rod for his tenkara rod, and liked white caterpillar kebari. Just wondering if you discussed his tenkara fishing?

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[David - I did not get a chance to stop and talk with him. He had already been stopped by a few people and you could tell he needed to be somewhere, still he was very polite. I am sad to hear that he has passed away, he was one of the great Japanese anglers. Thanks for sharing the information you found about him. I had never heard of the white caterpillar kebri until now. Some more research is needed to determine ingredients so I can tie my own Chōji-san caterpillar kebari.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Oh man, A missed opportunity. I still regret not going to the Winston-Salem FF show three years ago. It was only another 80 minute drive to see a friend I served on a submarine with for 4 years, and we remained friends for the next 36 years. I knew he was ill, two months later and after more than a month getting no replies to emails I called him. Only to have his brother answer his cell phone &amp; discover he had passed away a month earlier. Another is Mr Peal. Father of a high school classmate. Highly decorated Higgins boat driver in Europe during WW2. Which had enough pull to get his son, into the Naval Academy, and a granddaughter there now. I had been thinking of going to see him for a couple of years. Seems we always have a place we need to be. 

Anyway. do an internet search with 細山長司さん and you will find his Wikipedia page. Credited with pioneering a lot of mainstream fishing methods and equipment. Actually when I tried to search with his name Google came back with this suggested search phrase [ 細山長司さん死去, Mr Hosyama Chōji died] . The interview list he used 2 kebari patterns. Brown System/series Sakasa kebari, (or tea colored) and the White System Caterpillar kebari [ 茶系の逆さ毛バリと白系の毛虫毛鉤を].

It would be cool if you were able to talk more with Mr. Hayashi Kenzō「林謙三さん」and get one of his hand tied or tied in hand,  Akiyama Village tradition kebari 秋山郷風伝承毛鉤. I have found my clones of his pattern Fish Approved. 

Anyway, thanks for replying,]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you have spent any time in the Tenkara community you have most likely heard of <a href="https://www.discovertenkara.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discover Tenkara</a>. Whether it is because of their line of <a href="https://www.discovertenkara.co.uk/tenkara-rods.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tenkara rods</a>, the <a href="https://discover-tenkara.com/subscriber-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email tutorial</a> series, or the superb YouTube channel "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG_32fIivZzXnhZLcMdoiGA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tenkara In Focus</a>" they are building quite the name for  themselves in our close knit community. In March of 2016 I had the distinct pleasure of fishing with John and Paul of Discover Tenkara on the <a href="http://104.248.67.90/grayling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">River Don</a> in Britain. These guys really do know their way around a Tenkara rod, and in one day I learned more from them then in the past three years I spent Tenkara fly fishing combined! Over the past year I have been really enjoying the paid content that John and Paul have been publishing through their <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/959788147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gumroad online store</a>. I feel that there is a lot of value in their content so I have put together a Discover Tenkara review. I've reviewed gear on this site before from <a href="http://104.248.67.90/tenkara-usa-ito-unboxing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tenkara rods</a> to <a href="http://104.248.67.90/postfly-box-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flies</a> and <a href="http://104.248.67.90/sawanobori-stream-climbing-shoes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sawanobori</a> gear so I thought I'd offer my opinion on the Discover Tenkara (DT) <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/1003828339" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid content</a>, a Discover Tenkara review if you will.

<hr />

While Tenkara is a simple method to catch fish there is still a lot to learn. I like to compare Tenkara to skiing - you can learn it quickly but if you want to get down the mountain gracefully you will spend countless hours (possibly a lifetime) discovering the many nuances to become a true master. Anyone can plop a line in the water and eventually catch a few fish but catching fish with a fixed line rig does require some skill. Furthermore, if you want to tie authentic kebari based on centuries of experimentation and expertise you will have to study and sift through hundreds of poorly indexed websites. Fortunately for the Tenkara community John and Paul have done a lot of leg work exploring Japan and meeting with a wide variety of Japanese Tenkara enthusiasts. Through their hard work they have compiled a treasure trove of Tenkara and kebari information that anyone can study, digest, and enjoy at the cost of a few Starbucks Frappuccinos. Throughout the year I enjoy reading their wide collection DT's excellent books, studying their informative PDF's, and watching the fabulous video content that they release regularly.

<strong>To see all full collection of their content be sure to follow this link <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/1003828339" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></strong>

<a href="https://gumroad.com/a/1003828339/YzrT" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4679 size-large" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Ep3-DLC-PDF-929x1024.jpg" width="929" height="1024" data-id="4679" /></a>

The video content coming from DT is not just high quality but informative and beautiful to watch. I run my own YouTube channel (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtpkSNdhHkBkhdzsyge_-zw/videos?sort=dd&amp;view=0&amp;shelf_id=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>) that is decidedly very amateur. So I can appreciate not only the difficulties in capturing quality content but compiling and editing said content into an enjoyable storyline. I never get bored watching their videos, whether it be the "Tenkara In Focus" series or their growing library of content they have for <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/590689395" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sale</a>. Then there are their books and informative PDFs. I've purchased many of them and uploaded them to my offline Evernote notebook "Tenkara" and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/pdf-viewer-read-review-annotate/id1120099014?l=en&amp;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF Viewer</a> for on stream reference - as well as light reading for when I am dozing off in the tent after a long day of fishing.

Some of my favorites from Discovering Tenkara are:
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://gumroad.com/a/959788147/OSKL" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Vol. 1 An Introduction to Tenkara Basics &amp; Fundamentals</a></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A superb video with some great on stream footage, casting techniques, and other goodies. This one is definitely worth checking out, especially if you are new to Tenkara (I've been at it for year though and found this volume to be very informative).</em></p>

<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://gumroad.com/a/959788147/Iewfa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vol 2 Kebari - Patterns &amp; Principals</a></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>If you are into fly tying and are intrigued by sites like My Best Streams then this is the video for you. If you are really serious you should also consider getting the eBook <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/422917235" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discovering Kebari</a>. It has a lot of great information on the characteristics of kebari, tying strategies, employment techniques, and lots more.</em></p>

<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://gumroad.com/a/959788147/IDUQD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vol 3 Kebari - Practical Fishing Applications</a></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Some phenomenal footage from Japan including engaging interviews and fly tying sessions with some big names in the Japanese Tenkara community (the fish stalking lesson is spot on as well). </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">They have a lot more great content then what is listed above -<strong> to see all full collection of their content be sure to follow this link <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/590689395" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>  </strong></p>
I have found a lot of value in the Discover Tenkara content both paid and free. From tips on tying kebari to casting and stalking fish there are lots of little gems of information that are sure to satisfy veteran and beginner anglers alike. If you are looking to improve your Tenkara and kebari fly tying technique you need look no further than Discover Tenkara's wealth of compiled <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/959788147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge</a>.

		<title>Japanese Keiryu (Mountain Stream) Magazine</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I for one thoroughly enjoy every issue of the Japanese Keiryu (a.k.a. Mountain Stream) Magazine. Even though I cannot understand most of what is written (Google Translate only gets one so far) I am enthralled by the photography - and the maps. I am always interested to see where exactly these magical streams are that are featured in every issue. However, tracking down these genryu and keiryu can be a very daunting task. Sometimes I will spend an hour pouring over Google Maps searching for where they might be located, others pop right up on the first search.

[kadence_gallery id="4698"]

Well I have compiled my research in one place - I even color coded it by issue for easy reference. I have not track down every single genryu and keiryu listed yet though and I am missing a few issues (a problem that Amazon JP is helping me remedy). My goal in taking on this project has been to help those planning a visit to Japan with some initial research. If, for example you know you will be traveling around Matsumoto in Nagano Prefecture you can see what issue (or issues) of the Keiryu (Mountain Stream) Magazine featured river in that area. This should help prepare you as far as gear needs dictated by terrain - as well as seasonal requirements and even fishing permit information. Just another step in the direction in helping angling foreigners planning a visit to Japan.

For a more in-depth review of the magazine be sure to check out Tenkara Enso <a href="https://tenkaraenso.blogspot.jp/2014/08/headwater-genryu-magazine-summer-2014.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>

		<title>Winter Tenkara</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every February I start getting excited, and begin eagerly making plans for the March 1st opening day of Keiryu (mountain stream) fishing season. This year I wanted to get out on opening day but due to a nasty cold my trip was pushed back about a week. The morning of my departure I got an earlier start than anticipated due to my son's 3am feeding. I hit the road well before sunrise and made it to the trailhead in record time! Along the way I passed a digital thermometer road sign that said the temperature was -4°C, and that was at the lake - the trailhead was a few hundred meters higher. It was most certainly going to be a winter Tenkara trip.

It took about an hour for me to hike to the end of the logging road where I deployed my <a href="http://104.248.67.90/tenkara-usa-ito-unboxing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tenkara USA Ito</a> rod. The water was very cold and ice was everywhere, if I stood too long in one spot my felt soled shoes would freeze to the rock! So I opted to tie on a tungsten bead head nymph that <a href="https://rockandriffle.blogspot.jp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adam Klags</a> had given to me at the Bansho in <a href="http://104.248.67.90/exploring-aizu-interior-fukushima-prefecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aizu</a> last year - to get down deep where I knew the fish were. I have fished this river several times, the most recent was last August. Sometime since then a massive flood had ripped through the canyon and some of my favorite pools were now completely gone. The water was also lower than I had ever seen it. In a month or two when monsoon season arrives I am sure the water levels will increase and maybe the river will reclaim some of her more majestic plunge pools.

Rather than go through the whole day in words I thought I would let my photos (and the video) do the "talking" for me. I will say that this was the first trip with my <a href="https://www.simmsfishing.com/slick-jacket.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simms Slick Jacket</a>, <a href="https://www.zimmerbuilt.com/store/p34/TailWater_Pack.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zimmerbuilt Tailwaters pack</a>, and <a href="https://webshop.montbell.jp/goods/disp.php?product_id=1125323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Montbell Sawanobori</a> shoes - so at some point this season I will be writing a more detailed gear review on them.

Enjoy!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't let the name fool you, the <a href="https://www.zimmerbuilt.com/store/p34/TailWater_Pack.html" target="_blank">Zimmerbuilt Tailwaters Pack</a> is just at home in the ultra-remote drainages that I actively seek out; as it is in the more accessible waters found below hydraulic structures (as its name might imply).

After several outings with my <a href="https://www.zimmerbuilt.com" target="_blank">Zimmerbuilt</a> Tailwaters Pack I have been asking myself why I didn't get this pack sooner. I have fallen off of boulders into 45° mountain stream water up to my neck, and the contents of my pack have stayed dry. She carries all sorts of necessary gear (see photo below) with room to spare. Whether I am hiking or riding a mountain bike, she rides comfortably on my back. Splattered in mud and dragged through all manner of spiky brush she never bats an eye. In other words the Tailwaters pack is a perfect river companion - never complaining, always willing to take what you can dish out, and she always lets you fish the best holes.

[caption id="attachment_4780" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4780 size-large" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Zimmerbuilt-Tailwaters-Pack-Tenkara-Gear-backpack-keiryu-kebari-contents-tenkara-rods-1024x768.jpg" alt="Zimmerbuilt Tailwaters Pack" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4780" /> Contents (Top to Bottom): <br /> ⦿ Simms Slick Rain Jacket, Mammut Fleece, Tenryu Furaibo TF39TA, Badger Tenkara Classic <br /> ⦿ Montbell Neoprene Booties, 10m rope, extra buff and sunglasses <br /> ⦿ Knife, Sawyer Water Purification system, bear mace, beanie, map, fishing supplies, tissue and fire kit (lighter, windproof matches, and petroleum jelly soaked cotton balls), Ohuhu wood burning stove, and SnowPeak Titanium pot. <br /><br /> Not pictured - enough food for two people for a full day (e.g. onigiri, ramen, crackers, cheese, sandwiches, etc...)[/caption]

The Xpac VX07 &amp; VX21 material is durable and water resistant. The material does not feel supple, rather it feels stiff. The pack is impressively light weight, coming in at a claimed 8.75 ounces. While much of the ultralight gear out there feels like it will barely survive a season this pack feels solid and well built. My impression is that it will last a very long time.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4787 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Zimmerbuilt-Tailwaters-Pack-Tenkara-Gear-backpack-keiryu-kebari-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024" data-id="4787" />

I have used the elastic shock cord on the outside of the pack to carry wet gear and even a really cool Yezo sika deer antler (蝦夷鹿) that I discovered at the bottom of a deep pool. You can carry a net in it as well, but I haven't used one in my five years of Tenkara fishing - so I can't vouch for this.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4784 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Zimmerbuilt-Tailwaters-Pack-Tenkara-Gear-backpack-keiryu-kebari-antler-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024" data-id="4784" />

The tenkara rod quivers on either side of the pack are genius. All of my rods, except the Tenkara USA Ito rod (which sticks up pretty far above the pack) ride comfortably along the side of my back. The rods are easily accessible and protected. The best part though is that the quiver location offers snag free exploring. My Tenryu Furaibo TF39TA does not fit in the quiver (it is too short). Honestly, I am ok with this because I would rather have the rod inside my pack anyways.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4785 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Zimmerbuilt-Tailwaters-Pack-Tenkara-Gear-backpack-keiryu-kebari-moss-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4785" />

<strong>Things to Note:</strong>

There is no padding against the back so some care is needed when loading the pack.

I ordered the pack with a waist belt because I knew I would be accessing remote drainages by bicycle and I did not want the pack swinging around. However, on two occasions the waist strap came undone. The first time my bear mace fell off, the second time I almost lost my <a href="https://www.helle.no/products/knives/temagami/" target="_blank">Helle Temagami</a> knife forever! The issue can be easily fixed though by adding a plastic tri-slide to the strap and doubling the free end through it (once you have doubled it through the tri-slide that is attached permanently to the pack).

<img class="size-large wp-image-4786 aligncenter" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Zimmerbuilt-Tailwaters-Pack-Tenkara-Gear-backpack-keiryu-kebari-sugegasa-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024" data-id="4786" />

Overall I am very satisfied with the Zimmerbuilt Tailwaters Pack. At $95 it is a great deal. If you are in the market for a Tenkara pack you would be remiss to not seriously consider what Zimmerbuilt is offering.

		<title>Norikura Kogen - Mt. Kengamine</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Norikura Kogen sits high above the city of Matsumoto in Nagano Prefecture. The Norikura (乗鞍岳) mountain group is comprised of 20+ peaks, the highest of which is Kengamine (<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/剣ヶ峰" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">剣ヶ峰</a>) at 3026m. The area is actually an old volcano and is located relatively close to Mount Ontake, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Mount_Ontake_eruption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">erupted</a> on September 27, 2014 killing 63 people.

For a topo map of the region click <a href="https://maps.gsi.go.jp/#15/36.106685/137.553881/&amp;base=std&amp;ls=std&amp;disp=1&amp;vs=c1j0l0u0t0z0r0f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

<hr />

I visited Norikura Kogen last week for a spring skiing trip. While I was there I squeezed in a quick fishing excursion on the upper portion of the Koōnogawa (小大野川).

<img class="size-large wp-image-4834 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/norikura-kogen-nagano-gifu-northern-alps-spring-skiing-iwana-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4834" />

<img class="size-large wp-image-4836 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/norikura-kogen-nagano-gifu-northern-alps-spring-skiing-tenkara-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4836" />

The river's banks were covered in snow. It had been a <a href="https://www.badgertenkara.com/blog/iwana-tenkara-a-guest-post-by-isaac-tait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LONG</a> time since I had fished around snow. I was giddy with excitement as I crunched through the snow to get close enough to the water to cast.

I'm really starting to like my Tenryu Furaibo tenkara rod. The triple zoom has come in hand SO many times now, this excursion was no exception. Fine tuning the length gives me the flexibility to cast in spots that I might have skipped in the past. Unfortunately, it didn't help me catch any fish (in fact I didn't see any either). Nevertheless, it was still really nice to be out on such a beautiful mountain stream. Later on our ski guide, Yamaken told me that fishing in town wasn't so good, except for one very unassuming tributary near his companies lodge (it wasn't the river I was fishing)... Lesson learned for next time ;)

While the fishing isn't so great in town the area is rife with wonderful and remote rivers filled with fish. You just have to know where to <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/keiryu-magazine/">look</a>...

<hr />

After an hour or so on the river I made my way back to the lodge to meet our guide and suit up for the days adventure. After changing from fishing clothes into ski gear we made our way to the bus parking lot and got in line for the first bus. It was an hour ride from town and cost ¥1450. As we ascended the snow got deeper and deeper until we reached the end of the road where the snow was a good 3-4 meters above the tops of the bus! It was one of the best snow years the region had experienced in over a decade.

After a long ski tour with a 5,000+ foot descent we headed to the Yukemurikan Hot Spring (乗鞍高原温泉 湯けむり館) for a nice long soak. The onsen is tattoo friendly and it has a very high sulfur content, so make sure any jewelry is removed before soaking or else it could turn black. Afterwards, we said goodbye to our guide and headed into town for a <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/5448-4+Hata,+Matsumoto-shi,+Nagano-ken+390-1401/@36.2016219,137.8569021,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x601d13e3dfa672b7:0xb58c63e49c3e7e55!8m2!3d36.2016219!4d137.8574506?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">massive</a> (and surprisingly inexpensive) Chinese meal.

I couldn't finish it all :P[/caption]

It had been a wonderful multi-sport day, but we still had some epic Golden Week traffic to brave to get home.

<strong>Getting There</strong>

From Matsumoto take the train to Shinshimashima Station. To get deeper into the mountains, take the Highland Shuttle operated by <a href="https://www.alpico.co.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpico Group</a>. There are many options to choose from depending on how high up the mountain you want to go. To the summit from Shinshimashima Station it will take about 2 hours one way and cost you ¥2,800 one way (as of May 2017). The Chinese food restaurant is located within a 5 minute walk of the Hata Station.

If you are looking to hire a guide look no further than <a href="https://ridenorthstar.com/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Northstar Lodge</a>. They speak English and can accomadate both winter and summer adventures.

<p class="section-hero-header-title">Since becoming a father my Tenkara adventures have tapered off a little. This doesn't mean that my passion for the sport has abated though. I just spend more time than before pouring over maps, reading books and blogs about Tenkara, and of course studying my growing collection of <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/keiryu-magazine/">Keiryu</a> (渓流) and Yama to Tsuri (山と釣り) magazines. While flipping through the Summer 2013 and Spring 2015 issues of the Keiryu magazine my attention was caught by two rivers - the Shirotakawa and the Nishikawa. Both of these rivers are located on <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/izu-skyline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Izu Peninsula</a> - a landmass with a medley of mountains and oceans interspersed with epic beaches and cold mountain streams! When my wife's schedule finally aligned with mine I took the opportunity to take my <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/custom-camper-microvan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kei van</a> on a little road trip down to <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/black-ship-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Izu Peninsula</a> to explore those rivers.</p>


[caption id="attachment_4890" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4890 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Shirotakawa-wow-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4890" /> Where I started fishing the Shiratogawa! Not a bad morning[/caption]
<h4 class="section-hero-header-title">Shirotakawa</h4>
Located between Ito and Shimoda the Shirotakawa flows unimpeded to the ocean for much of its length. If you come in May the areas plentiful citrus groves will be in full bloom, the smell of which is absolutely intoxicating. Earlier in the year I hear that the cherry blossoms in this valley are phenomenal. Since fishing season lasts through October 31st you can even catch some great fall colors too!

Last season my friend Kado-san and I visited Hajime Murai (竿姫), a bamboo fishing rod maker who lives in the seaside town of Atami (blog report <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/herabuna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). While we were visiting him he gave me two Herabuna rods as a gift and promised to make me a custom net as well. Some seven months later the net was finished just in time for this trip. It was the first time in my tenkara "career" that I carried a net and I must say I see why so many people use them. Not only did Murai-san hand braid the net himself but he carved a fish into one side of the handle and my name in Katakana on the other side!

The rivers on Izu Peninsula experience a lot of pressure and since the region is so mountainous land is at a premium. Therefore it is difficult to find remote rivers and big fish. Still you can get lucky and besides Izu Peninsula has so much more to offer than just trout fishing. There are epic white sand beaches, ancient castles, rock climbing on sea cliffs, famous <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/onsens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">onsen</a> villages, thousands of kilometers of hiking trails, and of course sea food! If you venture down here be sure to sample as much of the landscape as you can.

[kadence_gallery id="4874"]
<h4 class="section-hero-header-title">Nishikawa</h4>
After fishing the Shirotakwa for several hours I packed up and headed to the next river on my list, the Nishikawa. It was about a 90 minute drive away, but it took me a lot longer than that to get there since there is just so much to see!

[caption id="attachment_4909" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-4909 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Higashiizu-panorama-1-1024x342.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="342" data-id="4909" /> The seaside village of Higashiizu[/caption]

Along the Shimoda highway (412) I stopped at the Mishima Shrine (三嶋神社) to snap some photos. Then I stopped at the Sansei-En Izu Matsuzaki <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/michi-no-eki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michi No Eki</a> to use the bathroom and scope out the Nakagawa River (那賀川), which is located in the quaint mountain village of Osawa (大澤). Next to the Michi No Eki is another picturesque Shinto shrine, Yama Shrine (山神社).
<div>
<p class="section-hero-header-title">Finally, I made it to the other side of Izu Peninsula and headed back into the mountains in search of more Amago. As I drove up the road I was a little alarmed that there was no water in the river bed! Turns out that the Nishinagawa Daini Power Station (仁科川第二発電所) redirects the water into underground pipes for several kilometers, but once you get above the power station the river is big, deep, and cold. It is a bummer though as all the fish above the power station are no doubt stocked. Sadly there are probably no sea run Amago in the upper reaches of this river.</p>

Since I only had a day to explore my time was limited on this river. The wind was also picking up so I took the opportunity to employ some of the techniques I had learned from the <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/992031859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bonus</a> material from <a href="https://www.discovertenkara.com/blog/masami_sakakibara_ep7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tenkara In Focus Episode 7</a>. I was able to employ many of the tips from the one and only Masami Tenkarano-Oni Sakakibara. These tips resulted in many surprise strikes and fish brought to hand from segments of the river that I never thought fish would hold in. It was really exciting! If you have not yet checked out the material, I highly recommend that you do so - here's the <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/992031859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>.

<hr />

After a fun day on two spectacular rivers I packed up and headed back home but not before stopping in at my new favorite ramen joint in Hiratsuka the famous Hanamizu Raoshan head office (花水ラオシャン本店). Their cashü ramen and gyoza are absolutely fabulous.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4908 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Hanamizu-Raoshan-ramen-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4908" />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Katashina, Gunma Prefecture - Japan</h4>
I have come to Katashina region of Japan every season since I moved here. It truly is a magnificent place that offers great fishing and epic scenery only a few hours from Tokyo. The public transit to get here is surprisingly easy too, so if you've got a Japan Rail Pass (and a little knowledge of the bus system) you are all set!.

Earlier this month I was fortunate to visit Katashina on two separate trips. The first trip was with Paul and John from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TenkaraInFocus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tenkara In Focus</a>. They had spent the past two weeks or so traveling with Go Ishii all over Japan. Much of their trip had been spent gathering content for future Tenkara In Focus episodes; so they were jonesing for some fishing action, which I was happy to provide.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4959 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/oze-national-park-gunma-prefecture-tenkara-japan-kebari-downstream-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024" data-id="4959" />

The second visit to Katashina was a few days later when I went to help my friend Kado-san clean out his small cabin. His "cabin" is right in the middle of the village and is actually a three century old refurbished silk factory. While I was there working I did manage to squeeze in two fishing sessions on the highly pressured yet beautiful Ogawa River, which runs right through the middle of town.

<img class="size-large wp-image-4938 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/katashina-oze-national-park-Hotaka-Farm-Ski-Area-katashina-kogen-mountains-tenkara-japan-clouds-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4938" />

Due to the areas proximity to Tokyo and how many times I have visited the region I thought it would be a good idea to write a feature piece on the area. So without further ado here it is my first "centerpiece" article on the Katashina region of Japan.

<hr />

<h5>Getting There</h5>
The nearest train station is Numata Station, which is 2.5 hours by shinkansen from Tokyo Station.

To get to the trailhead for Oze National Park, you'll take the bus from Numata Station 沼田 - 群馬県 to the Oshimizu bus stop 大清水 - 群馬県, which takes 1.5 hours and will cost you ¥2,250.

If you want to get off in the village proper of Katashina you should plan to get off the bus early around the 鎌田上 stop.

There is plenty of lodging in the village but I prefer to camp. For restaurants and <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/onsens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">onsens</a> there are several good options (I've only listed the ones I have been to).
<ul>
 	<li>Ramen (鎌田食堂)</li>
 	<li>Hokkori Onsen (ほっこりの湯)</li>
 	<li>TamaO Kitchen (ごはん屋 たまおKITCHEN)</li>
 	<li>Marunuma Onsen (加羅倉館)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/%E3%81%9D%E3%81%B0%E6%BA%90/@36.6402989,139.0076257,13z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x601e6085c836ae59:0xd799356889717292!2sGunma+Prefecture!3b1!8m2!3d36.3906675!4d139.0604061!3m4!1s0x0:0x388af764bff6293a!8m2!3d36.6509991!4d139.0392566?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soba</a> noodles and Tempura (そば源) This restaurant is back in Numata, but is very famous and worth a visit if you are in the area.</li>

<h4>Katashinagawa (片品川)</h4>
<img class="size-large wp-image-4969 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/oze-national-park-gunma-prefecture-tenkara-japan-kebari-paul-and-john-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-id="4969" />

When I heard that Paul and John were planning another trip to Japan I was excited to link up with them. Due to schedule conflicts and last minute change in plans it looked liked I might miss them again. Then I got a Line message from Go Ishii asking if I could take Paul and John on a private tour on May 31st since he had some stuff to take care of in town. I was happy to oblige and so we made plans to meet in the Numata area where I would take Paul and John on a Tenkara adventure.

I got on the road early to beat the traffic going through Tokyo and consequently I arrived in Numata several hours before the scheduled meeting time. I tried to sleep in my car but I was too excited (and a little nervous too) for the days adventures. Thanks to Go's race car driving ways Paul and John arrived early though, and after a brief discussion in the parking lot of Lawsons Paul and John piled in my van and Go headed back home to Tokyo.

On the drive to the "trailhead" the three of us chatted about all manner of topics mostly pertaining to Tenkara; we laughed, joked, and discussed plans for the day. The one hour drive passed quickly and before we knew it we were parked at the trailhead donning our wet wading gear. It was a warm day and after a 30 minute walk in the woods it was refreshing to plunge into the snow melt fed stream. John and Paul fished for a while and I watched - I live in Japan so I was happy to let them take point. The scenery was spectacular and I kept myself busy snapping photos and shooting some video.

After six hours or so of fishing we packed up our rods and hiked upstream to the waterfall. It was starting to get late and we hadn't covered as much ground as we had planned because the fishing had been too good (it's a rough problem to have). When we arrived at the waterfall Paul and John setup their cameras to shoot some videos. As we were preparing for a final group photo I noticed that the water had suddenly become quite murky. Fearing an impending flood and realizing we were on the wrong side of the river, we quickly packed up. In the minute or two it took to put the cameras away the water had turned to the color of chocolate milk and had risen about 30 cm (one foot)! We plunged into the river, which was now above our waists. Thankfully we were able to safely make it to the other side. However, the only way back to the car was to climb up a 30 meter cliff. We took our time climbing occasionally looking down at the flooding river and in short order we were standing at the top looking at the flooding river far below.

The flood was strange as we saw no debris floating downstream at the onset and it did not appear to be raining upstream. It was a warm day so it must have just been snow flash melting really late in the day. Whatever the cause it was exciting and a good reminder to respect the mountains.

That night we dined on some fabulous soba and delicious tempura at the famous <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/%E3%81%9D%E3%81%B0%E6%BA%90/@36.650998,139.037059,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!1m2!10m1!1e3!3m4!1s0x601e68271afc1885:0x388af764bff6293a!8m2!3d36.650998!4d139.039253?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">そば源 </a>restaurant. If you find yourself in Numata I highly recommend this place. Come hungry, their menu is quite substantial. After a long drive I got John and Paul to their hotel in Kawaguchi around midnight. After helping them with their luggage I bought a coffee from a vending machine and drove home arriving a little after 1am, just in time to feed my son his midnight bottle.

<h4>Ogawa (小川)</h4>

When I first came to Japan one of my very first Tenkara trips was to Katashina with my friend Kado-san. We fished several rivers and at night we slept in his "cabin". So, when he mentioned that he need some help cleaning out some old ski equipment from the attic I was more than happy to offer my services. The neighborhood around his "cabin" is quite picturesque and the river is beautiful.

[kadence_gallery id="4988"]

There are two rivers that run through Katashina, the Ogawa and the Katashinagawa. The Ogawa is a shorter river and its headwaters are in a more populated area, therefore it sees more pressure and doesn't feel as remote. Over the weekend I did see a lot of fishermen on the Ogawa and due to the lack of C&amp;R fishing ethic in Japan (a fact that I find almost as frustrating as their penchant for building dams) there wasn't many fish in the river. However, I did get very lucky and brought to hand quite possibly the largest fish in the river! She put up quite a fight, putting a nice bend in my Tenryu Furaibo TF39TA, and even took me for a run!

While the Ogawa isn't really a destination river if you're in town and have a few hours free it does offer some fun fishing. And who knows maybe you'll get lucky and catch 'big bertha' :D

If you are planning a visit to Tokyo and want to do some hiking and fishing Katashina is hard to beat. The locals are very friendly and the public transportation is easy and frequent. There are several ski resorts in the area too and even some great backcountry skiing so this area is literally a four season destination.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Akiyamago 秋山郷</h4>
On the western flank of Mount Naeba there are twelve tiny villages that are tucked into a rugged and remote valley. The area is known as Akiyamago. Even though it is fairly close to Tokyo the area does not see a lot of pressure, plus there are numerous rivers in the area so finding solitude is fairly easy.

You can buy a fishing ticket at Yamada-san's minshuku <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/%E9%9B%84%E5%B1%B1%E8%8D%98/@36.82725,138.625707,18z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sakiyamago!3m4!1s0x0:0xd453f236901c0f48!8m2!3d36.827959!4d138.6245971?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (or the famous Kiriake Hot Springs if he isn't home). The tickets cost ¥500 for the upper canyon and ¥800 for the lower canyon per day. It is important to buy the fishing ticket beforehand as several of the rivers in the area are closed to fishing (you get a free map when purchasing a fishing ticket that show the closed rivers). Last year two fishermen were caught fishing a closed stream. They had kept 25 fish (sadly the removal of exorbitant amount of fish is very common in Japan), consequently they were fined over ¥3,000,000 ($30,000.00)!! So make sure you are fishing in the right spot.

<img class="size-large wp-image-5033 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/akiyamago-torikabuto-nagano-prefecture-tenkara-japan-clouds-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024" data-id="5033" />

I had actually visited this area <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/torikabuto-nagano-prefecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last season</a> with my friend Hama. It was such a great trip and I really wanted to come back to do some more exploring. This past April I received an email from <a href="https://twitter.com/themappist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Gamache</a>. He and I had been exchanging emails and Twitter messages for over a year discussing tenkara, Japan, and the possibility of meeting face to face to do some fishing. After several calendar conflicts, funding issues, and last minute cancelations the stars finally aligned and we made plans to fish in Akiyamago together.

[kadence_gallery id="5027"]

At 0330 I met my friend Junpei out front of my home and we drove into Tokyo to pick up Martin who had flown in the day before. Since it was super early in the morning we made good time into the mountains and by 0830 we were in Akiyamago. We suited up at the trailhead and piled into the back of  Yamada-san's kei truck for a quick drive down a bumpy dirt road. Midway down the road we came across a recent rock slide that was blocking the road. Martin and I proceeded to clear the slide while Junpei and Yamada-san returned to the trailhead to retrieve some forgotten gear. I was in the process of recovering from a particularly nasty lung infection and clearing the rock slide took a lot out of me. It was day one of three though so I pushed through the pain. Still I was brought to my knees several times that day with a rib cracking cough.

There was four in our party, but the river was running wide and deep so you could have an angler on each side of the river and those behind mopped up the overlooked areas, sometimes with good results. The fishing was slow in the morning but as we got further upstream the fishing action picked up, somewhere around 30+ fish all caught and released except for one between the four of us. I ended up catching the last fish of the day. After letting my kebari drift through a promising spot I left it in the water and moved upstream trolling my line behind me with the intent of using the water tension to snap my kebari upstream on the next cast. Suddenly my line came tight, I had a fish on! The fish were definitely getting hungry, but we had to turn around due to an impassable gorge (swimming that late in the day in the snowmelt fed river was not a viable option).

The second day dawned clear and cool. Once again the fishing at first was slow and then it picked up considerably. John Pearson had given me a Karasu (crow) feather kebari during his <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/katashina/">recent trip</a> and the fish were slamming it left and right. Nine of the ten fish I brought to hand and released that day were with the Karasu kebari. As the fishing picked up rain clouds moved in and it dumped rain for the rest of the day. Around 1500 Martin and I were getting very hungry and cold so we called it quits for the day. The siren song of the onsen in Yamada-san's minshuku was too hard to resist. It was our last night in Akiyamago and so we stayed up late sipping beer and talking about bear hunting, <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/sansai-mountain-vegetables/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sansai</a>, and tenkara with Yamada-san.

[kadence_gallery id="5050"]

Yamada-san is a wonderful host. The first day he guided us on the river and that evening he gave us a Soba making lesson in the minshuku's kitchen. He is quite famous for his soba and the wooden soba making bowls he hand carves during the long winter months. It was truly an honor to spend two days and two nights in his company. The third and last day of our trip was upon us and we decided to head to another nearby region called Kiyotsu. There was a secret spot my friend Kado-san and I had visited <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/susuki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last season</a> and I was eager to see if it would be as productive as last time.

<h4 class="section-hero-header-title">Kiyotsu 清津峡</h4>
North of Mount Naeba there are several river valleys, the most famous of which is probably Kiyotsu Gorge. Many of the rivers in the vicinity though offer some fun fishing. Motivated by the memories of last seasons fishing action I suggested to Martin and Junpei that we head there on our third and last day. While the last two days had been spent on big water the Kiyotsu region is rife with small and tight keiryu. My Tenryu Furiabo had felt a little outgunned the last few days but the rivers in this area are the Furaibo's bread and butter.

<img class="size-large wp-image-5077 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Kiyotsu-region-niigata-prefecture-japan-tenkara-isaac-junpei-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-id="5077" />

After hiking for about thirty minutes we dropped into the river valley and deployed our rods. I spotted a few fish in the first few pools and then for about two hours we didn't see a single fish. This was a new section of river for me and I kept telling the guys that last season the fishing was great higher up. So we pushed on to the section I had fished before. When we got there we saw a few more fish but they were very jittery and sneaking up on them was almost impossible. After about five hours of fishing I finally hooked a small Iwana and about 20 minutes later Martin nabbed one too. At the gorge that my friend Kado-san had eaten somen at last season I spotted floodwater debris 3-5 meters up in the trees next to the river. Sometime since last September there had been what looked like a very big flood. We speculated that the flood was the reason for the lackluster fishing that day. It will probably take a season for the river to bounce back. If another angler visits it though this season and pulls 25 fish from the river, it may remain devoid of fish forever...

[kadence_gallery id="5056"]

We wrapped up the day with a nice long soak at the inexpensive inn/onsen 渓山荘 and an absolutely delicious dinner at the <a href="https://www.kometarou.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kometarou (かま炊きめしやこめ太郎) restaurant</a>. The traffic on the Kan-etsu was unusually light and so we made good time getting into Tokyo to drop off Martin at his AirBnB. He had about 12 hours until his flight back to China and a few errands to run with Go Ishii the next day. I was missing my son Tadashi and eager to get home while simultaneously sad to be leaving the mountains behind. It had been a wonderful trip, the type of trip that makes me fall in love with Japan all over again. Good food, great people, awesome friends, and some seriously fun fishing - all in a gorgeous landscape. Japan is truly an amazing country.]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been just over a month since I have wet a fly. The last trip was a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/mount-naeba/" target="_blank">doozy </a>though so I cannot be too upset. As a sort of consolation, this July I have been on numerous hikes and beach trips with my son Tadashi and his aunt and uncle who visited Japan for their summer vacation. I have even managed a few mountain bike rides; honestly the hand sized spiders and the humidity have really put a damper on my enthusiasm for local mountain activities though.</p>

<p>As I was looking through my "old" photos from early season fishing trips I came across photos from a few trips that never made their way onto Fallfish Tenkara. So I figured later is better than never, so here you go!</p>

<p>This past April my friend Junpei discovered tenkara. I took him on a few trips to pass on my limited knowledge. He is actually quite talented and picked it up very quickly, I keep telling him that he must have some <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/shokuryoshi-tenkara/" target="_blank">Shokuryōsha (職漁者)</a> in his blood.</p>

<p>The University of Virginia and the University of Pittsburgh have sponsored a cool little project - <em>"the Japanese Text Initiative, a collaborative effort to make texts of classical Japanese literature available on the World Wide Web". </em>Part of this project included translating the<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogura_Hyakunin_Isshu" target="_blank">Ogura Hyakunin Isshu</a> - you can view the complete collection <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jti.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/hyakunin/frames/hyakuframes.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I took a few of my favorite Japanese Waka poems and some of my unused video footage from my early season tenkara trips and created this video.</p>

<p>I have built this site from the ground up based on two mediums - word and visual. I have never been 100% happy with my YouTube channel. I feel that my videos always miss the mark of what I am trying to communicate - namely the wonder and majesty of Japan. I think the video, while brief, comes a little closer to expressing how much Japan has impacted me.</p>

<p>As I am writing this my son is sitting next to me enthralled with my typing and starring with wonder at the photos of fish and wild mountain landscapes. Yesterday he had his first fever, but today he is back to his normal playful self. I am hoping to take him on his first fishing trip next month. I think we will head up to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/bRC4y17hWkw" target="_blank">Oshino</a>.</p>

<p>Last week Go Ishii and Martin Gamache went on an epic fishing trip in the Sho-kawa area, to quote them "it is the best time of the year for tenkara here, so we are catching a lot of fish. It is a shaku-fest!" During the same week Junpei attempted to SUP across Lake Okutone to access some of the more remote rivers. He was shutdown though because he did not have a wetsuit and overnight camping is forbidden on the lake or the rivers that fill the lake. He opted to fish in the nearby <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/oze-national-park/" target="_blank">Oze National Park</a> instead.</p>

<p>So that has been my July so far. Anyone reading this been on a cool trip this month? If so share it in the comments below, so that I can live vicariously through you :D</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At the emphatic suggestion from a good friend of mine I headed up to Yokohama with my son to check out a soup curry restaurant called <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/KIKUYA%E3%83%BBCURRY/@35.4491728,139.6220584,16z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x60185c8a6564cbad:0xf73a4dd61507cb69!2sHinodecho+Station!8m2!3d35.445521!4d139.6266812!3m4!1s0x0:0x99caf2855e1fdaa8!8m2!3d35.4484609!4d139.6270104?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kikuya ∙ Curry</a>. The restaurant is located within walking distance from both the Hinodecho Station and the Sakuragicho Station. The restaurant is small seating only 17 people, but their friendly service and absolutely delicious curry make this place worth the wait even if there is a line. I personally do not like to stand in lines with an infant in 90% humidity so I went after the lunch rush and was seated immediately. I ordered the potato chicken curry medium spicy with a large rice. It was absolutely delicious. Next time I think I will try the potato and cheese dish, which is my friends favorite.

<img class="size-large wp-image-5315 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/River-Walk-Magazine-Yokohama-Japan-Iseyamakōtai-Jingū-Shrine-1024x466.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="466" />

Unfortunately, I did not get any photos of my food because they do not have high chairs -  my hands were too full holding a squirming six month old to take any (there are plenty of food porn photos at the Tablelog page <a href="https://tabelog.com/en/kanagawa/A1401/A140102/14004143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> though). After lunch we stopped in at the beautiful <a href="https://www.iseyama.jp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iseyamakōtai Jingū Shrine (伊勢山皇大神宮)</a> before heading over to the<a href="https://colettemare-yokohama.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Colette ∙ Mare</a> shopping mall to find a baby changing room.

<img class="size-large wp-image-5139 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/River-Walk-Magazine-Yokohama-Japan-Flowers-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-id="5139" />

While I was browsing through the mall I came across a <a href="https://colettemare-yokohama.com/shop/874" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinokuniya</a> bookstore that had an extensive collection of Japanese trekking and fishing books and magazines. One title jumped out to me immediately "River Walk - First Issue" I picked it up and immediately knew I had to purchase a copy.

[caption id="attachment_5138" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<img class="wp-image-5138 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/River-Walk-Magazine-Yokohama-Japan-cover-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024" data-id="5138" /> What could be better than a bear with a tenkara rod?[/caption]

The magazine is similar to Yama to Tsuri (山と釣り) in layout, attention to detail, and the emotions it invokes while flipping through its pages. It is not a fly fishing only magazine though as it incorporates all disciplines of mountain stream fishing found in Japan. The photography is exceptional and there were several artwork pieces too, which I found very engaging.

<img class="size-large wp-image-5141 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/River-Walk-Magazine-Yokohama-Japan-kawanazumi-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-id="5141" />

There were several interesting articles including one about Chichibu's (秩父) Iwana (Chichibu's mountains streams are a mecca for mountain stream fishing that is very close to Tokyo). There was some great photography from a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/420827871266964/permalink/1746457212037350/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">river snorkeler</a>. As well as a cool feature of a young pyrography artist whose medium is drift wood found on mountain streams. And of course there is enough fishing photos to make anyone want to buy a plane ticket to Japan immediately.

River Walk also maintains a <a href="https://river-walk.co.jp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teru.wakabayashi.7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> page, and <a href="https://twitter.com/WakabayashiWalk?lang=ja" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> profile.

The first issue was published on September 30, 2016. The second issue should be hitting the shelves this summer; I am excited to see what content, artwork, and photography the next issue will feature. You can purchase your own copy of Issue One on Amazon Japan <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/RIVER-WALK-First-Issue/dp/4990915909/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501041702&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=river+walk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_5168" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-5168 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Kipposhi-Ramen-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-id="5168" /> Kipposhi Ramen in Sumida, Tokyo[/caption]

Japan is an awesome country, not only is the <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/mount-naeba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fishing</a> a lot of fun but there are hundreds of thousands of places to see, experience to absorb, and a culinary cornucopia of taste on every street corner. While Fallfish Tenkara has focused mostly on the first two I have not really touched on Japanese food besides a <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/japanese-cuisine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photo piece</a> several years back. Since I moved here in November of 2014 I can honestly say that I have not had a bad meal in Japan - the service is always top notch, the food prepared with care and attention to detail; and the flavors, textures, and smells are always out of this world.

Since we adopted a Japanese infant boy my mountain adventures have tapered off a bit. However, it has just been an opportunity to experience the culture, people, and food in and around the greatest metropolis in the world - that my mountain pursuits precluded me from enjoying before.

[caption id="attachment_5201" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<img class="wp-image-5201 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Tadashi-Tait-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024" data-id="5201" /> My son Tadashi makes friends where ever he goes. Here he is with two young ladies that we just met a few moments before the photo was taken.[/caption]

I thought it might be fun to highlight a few of the places I have eaten at over the past few months, which has increased since I became a full time stay at home dad (in Japan it is called ikumen イクメン aka "a man who enjoys child rearing"). Somedays Tadashi and I will head into Tokyo for the day for the express purpose of dining at a particular establishment. Like the day we went to Kikuyakari (Kikuya Curry); check out their Table log page <a href="https://tabelog.com/en/kanagawa/A1401/A140102/14004143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. There was a nice lady who sat next to Tadashi and I, and since the restaurant did not have any high chairs she quickly finished her food, so that she could hold Tadashi while ate my lunch. I did not even get her name, but I was touched deeply by her compassion.

Even chain restaurants are really good in Japan. The first time I had takoyaki (octopus balls) I thought

"Wow, I had no idea octopus had scrotums."

Later I discovered that takoyaki was actually diced up octopus fried in dough balls. I am blond what can I say... Anyways <a href="https://www.gindaco.com/highball/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gindaco Highball</a> makes a mean takoyaki with all sorts of fun toppings and you can wash it down with my favorite alcoholic beverage in Japan - the highball. They have restaurants all over Japan, if you see one stop in you will not regret it.

Speaking of chain restaurants <a href="https://www.kagetsu.co.jp/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kagetsu Arashi Ramen</a> is top notch and definitely worth trying. If you are looking for a smaller mom and pop ramen joint you should check out <a href="https://menyashota.nomaki.jp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Men'ya Shōta</a> next to Tsukuihama Station. It is a five minute walk to the ocean and ten minutes from Tsukuihamakankono Orchards where you can pick your own strawberries! If you are a ramen nut like me then a visit to Japan would not be complete without visiting the <a href="https://www.raumen.co.jp/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shin Yokohama Ramen Museum</a>. I have tried every ramen they offer. What is my favorite? All of them. Go hungry - seriously hungry. If possible avoid going on Sundays unless you do not mind standing in line for two hours...

Awhile back I did a piece on a ski/tenkara adventure I had in <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/norikura-kogen/">Norikura Kogen</a>. After the ski trip we stopped in at <a href="https://tabelog.com/en/nagano/A2002/A200201/20011756/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> Chinese restaurant called Chuugokuryourifukushingen (中国料理 福鑫源) I will be seriously impressed if you can pronounce that btw. If you are around Matsumoto and really really hungry this place is a great option.

Last, but certainly not least is <a href="https://youtu.be/erEtUtEJuBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kipposhi Ramen</a> which is quite famous for their blue ramen. The coloring is achieved using algae (not food dye) and is delicious. The restaurant seats ten and there is always a line, but it is definitely worth the wait. It is in Sumida under the shadow of the Tokyo Skytree.

If I had a hundred lifetimes I would not be able to experience 10% of the dinning in Tokyo. If you are planning a trip to Japan spend some time exploring the side streets and less traveled areas and when you see a restaurant - why not give it a try? You never know what you will find (I am willing to bet it will be the best meal you have ever had).

		<title>Lake Tanzawa</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have always met the end of the mountain stream fishing season here in Japan with a bit of wistfulness. The close of this season was a little more pensive for me though than usual<em>. </em>This season was my final full keiryu angling season as a resident of Japan. It has now been relegated to fond memories without the possibility of the addition of more. In six months I will board a plane and return to the great nation of united states - America. It was a good season, albeit I did not get out as much as I wanted (isn't this true for everyone though?) but I sure did finish it off with a bang. My tale today takes place some 700 meters above Lake Tanzawa; there you will <a href="https://kawasakiflyfishing.wordpress.com/2017/05/11/how-i-survived-falling-and-breaking-my-leg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find</a> a majestic and rugged genryu, tucked into a remote valley brimming with all manner of life. While my time in Japan is not yet finished this journey into<em> "a good land; a land with brooks, streams, and deep springs gushing out into the valleys and hills."</em> has surpassed my wildest dreams. Thankfully it is not over quite yet. I have a Japanese son now, so I will say with the highest confidence a man can conjure that I will be back! There are so many places I wanted to visit that despite living in Japan for three years I was unable to turn from dream to reality. So, I have to come back, there are too many areas on my bucket list.

Alas, enough waxing poetic from me - on to the headwaters of Lake Tanzawa!

It was not even 3am yet and the wind was howling - like <a href="http://www.tenkarausa.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=6668&amp;p=36716#p36716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many</a> of my best fishing days this one was starting out with rain, a lot of rain. Oddly enough the rain decreased as the drive took me closer to the mountains. When I got to the trailhead the rain had stopped but it was still too dark to ride my bike (I had forgotten my bike lights at home... Not to mention I was a little concerned about running into bears or boars), so I dressed slowly and packed and repacked my <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/zimmerbuilt-tailwaters-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pack</a>. After burning some time the sky brightened up sufficiently and I hoped on my bike and pedaled up the road my bear bell clanging away.

My sub 12kg XC race rig is now a reality![/caption]

The trail map said it was a three plus hour hike, but on my bike I was making really good time until I got to this tunnel. It was 327 meters long and completely dark inside. After working up the courage I descended into the pitch black abyss alone, and armed only with my iPhone's punny torch. Halfway through and engulfed in blackness with no light behind or in front of me there was suddenly a loud roar. My hair stood on end and I reached for my knife on my waist belt. As suddenly as the noise began it subsided and I realized it was just the sound of a small rock slide reverberating through the tunnel.

Safely on the other side and back in the light the steepness of the road increased and soon I was soaked in sweat despite the cool 19° mountain air. After 90 minutes of riding I made it to the point where the dirt track ended and the genryu began. So I locked up my bike and proceeded on foot. As soon as I got into the river I started spotting fish. It was a good sign! I fished for awhile and got a few bites but missed the sets. Then I came around a bend in the river and was greeted by a massive weir/dam. It took me a while to find a safe way up and over.

<img class="size-large wp-image-5190 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tanzawa-mountains-tenkara-iwana-catch-and-release-end-of-the-season-weir-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" />

The weather report said the rain was supposed to taper off by 0600. However, it started raining at 0700 and rained lightly almost the entire day. I was glad to have my Simms Slick Jacket, which kept me warm and dry the whole day.

[kadence_gallery id="5290"]

It was a great day of fishing, scrambling, and exploring. It had been awhile since I had made it deep into the mountains and with every passing step and spotted fish I could feel my spirits lifting <a href="https://outdoorempire.com/11-reasons-fishing-makes-you-healthier-happier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher and higher</a>. The fall colors were starting but still there were a plethora of wildflowers and rain soaked moss to admire.

[caption id="attachment_5174" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-5174 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tanzawa-mountains-tenkara-iwana-catch-and-release-end-of-the-season-almost-30cm-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /> Throughout the day I saw two plus dozen fish of which I brought five to hand; including this 28cm beauty. All were released.[/caption]

Half way up the valley the river forked, I went left first and found massive boulders and lots of plunge pools. However, down low there was a fish barrier and so I did not see many fish as I continued up (I did spot a <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/nihon-kawanezumi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kawanezumi</a> high up near a cave named after a famous domain in Zelda though... but maybe it was a fish???).

<img class="size-large wp-image-5175 aligncenter" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tanzawa-mountains-tenkara-iwana-catch-and-release-end-of-the-season-big-boulder-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" />

I backtracked to the fork and proceeded up. There were more fish but the river was tight, many of the pools I was unable to get a line into. That is okay though because those pools are what keep fish in these mountains since many anglers who visit this area do not practice catch and release. Throughout the day I could not help but think how many fish lived in this genryu a hundred years ago. Maybe 1,000 per kilometer? We will never know... If I were to venture a guess I would say that in the three seasons I have fished in Japan I have caught 500+ fish and I only kept four or five, and those were from ultra-remote <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/backcountry-tenkara/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genryu</a>. I always practiced C&amp;R in the Tanzawa Mountains ...

[caption id="attachment_5177" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-5177 size-large" src="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tanzawa-mountains-tenkara-iwana-catch-and-release-end-of-the-season-end-of-the-day-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /> High point for the day on the right keiryu[/caption]

With the sun dipping behind the trees I knew it was time to start heading back to my bike and the <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/custom-camper-microvan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">van</a>. I did not want to leave, I was a little bit sad. I consoled myself with the fact that it had been a good day of fishing. Finding shaku Iwana or Yamame (aka 30cm fish) in the Tanzawa Mountains is very difficult - it has only happened <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/tanzawa-mountains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once</a> for me. Today I had gotten close, only two centimeters shy. When my son 正 gets old enough, who knows maybe we will come back once the conservation mindset has taken a hold (it is starting too right now!) and we will find a multitude of shaku Iwana. I can see us now, dinning on yaki-onigiri deep in these mountains while I tell him about all my adventures here when he was just a little baby... I will take him to this genryu high above Lake Tanzawa, that would be a good time I think.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2013 when I discovered tenkara I never would have imagined where the pastime would take me. At the time I was living in Maryland and I was having a blast stalking <a href="http://104.248.67.90/fallfish-maryland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fallfish</a>, Panfish, Bass, and the occasional Rainbow or Brown Trout with my fixed line fishing rod (aka a tenkara rod). Then in the spring of 2014 we got the news that my wife and I would be moving to Japan. I was simultaneously excited and apprehensive; unsure of what to expect and looking forward to the adventure of moving to another country. At the time I worked at REI where I split my time between the sales floor and the bike shop. My manager was a fly fishing nut and we went fishing together a few times. When I told him I was moving to Japan he let me borrow his copy of <a href="http://confluencefilms.com/films/connect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connect</a>. The movie is divided into six segments featuring rivers in the United States, Cuba, Africa, and Japan. I can still remember the evening I watched that movie curled up on the couch while the fire flies danced outside and a deer was snacking on our apple tree (G-d I loved Maryland). The Japan segment came on and in an instant I knew I was going to have a blast fishing in the land of the rising sun.

At the time when I first watched the video I had no idea where Jimmy Bartschi (the protagonist) went fishing with Masa Ketsumatsu (sp?) other than the obvious - that it was close to Tokyo. Perhaps the Okutama region or maybe Chi Chibu? For years I pondered where they might have gone...

Over the last few years of living in Japan I have honed my keiryu sleuthing abilities to a razor sharp edge. So, in an effort to find the river they fished and to better understand where my love affair with Japanese rivers first started I pulled out my hypothetical Sherlock Holmes hat and pipe and began sleuthing. An hour or so later with about 20 tabs open on my browser not only had I discovered the river but the exact location of the weir that Jimmy and Masa cross at the 3:30 mark! The result surprised me, I had been there before and did not even know it! I'll give you a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fallfishtenkara/posts/651879555016102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hint</a>.

If you would like to watch the Japanese segment of the video I found it on Vimeo! Enjoy

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few months into the off season without wetting a fly, the itch to catch some fish reached a fevered pitch. My friend Go Ishii knew of a nice spot in Matsuda (松田町) tucked away deep in the <a href="http://104.248.67.90/lake-tanzawa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tanzawa Mountains</a> of Kanagawa Prefecture. I had never been and so I was excited to check it out. This was going to be an extra special trip for several reasons: firstly it was to be the first time Go and I were going tenkara fishing together. We had been on several fishing trips together before but for <a href="http://104.248.67.90/goby-fishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goby</a> or <a href="http://104.248.67.90/november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wakasagi</a>, not Masu. Secondly it was going to be my son Tadashi's first fishing trip! Lots of firsts, it was shaping up to be a great day.

The drive from home to the river went smoothly and in short order Tadashi and I arrived at the parking lot. It was a very cold day, barely above freezing and there was snow and ice on the ground. I bundled my son up in his snow suit, donned a few extra layers and my new waders, and Go and I headed down to the river armed with the <a href="http://www.discovertenkara.com/karasu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karasu</a> 360 and 400.

[caption id="attachment_5409" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-5409 size-large" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Go-Ishii-Ramen-Tenkara-Matsuda-Kanagawa-Prefecture-Japan-fishing-hut-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /> Hut where you buy your fishing ticket for the day (¥3,000 C&amp;R)[/caption]

It took Go all of 30 seconds to land the first fish. I had heard he was a master tenkara angler but this really blew my mind. Stocked rainbow in a heavily pressured "pay to play" river mid winter and he brings one to hand with a kebari no less. <strong>Impressive</strong>!

[kadence_gallery id="5405"]

The river was beautiful and the sky was blue. I caught a few fish, Go caught a lot more. My son loved it, which made me very happy. He got mad when I released the fish because he wanted to keep petting them. Around 2pm our growling stomachs got too hard to ignore, so we packed up and headed down to Hiratsuka to get some ramen!

[caption id="attachment_5406" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<img class="wp-image-5406 size-large" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Go-Ishii-Ramen-Tenkara-Matsuda-Kanagawa-Prefecture-Japan-e1520208457225-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024" /> There is no better way to wrap up a great day of cold fishing then with a bowl ramen![/caption]

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A Year Learning from a Japanese Bamboo Craftsman a.k.a. Wazao Shokunin</h3>

I first met Masayuki Yamano in September of 2016 at the Bansho in Fukushima Prefecture (more details <a href="http://104.248.67.90/exploring-aizu-interior-fukushima-prefecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>). Little did I know then how much he would impact my life. Now that I am back in the United States I wanted to share with my readers and the tenkara community at large my experiences learning from a third generation Wazao Shokunin.

[caption id="attachment_5467" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-5467 size-large" src="http://104.248.67.90/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/masayuki-yamano-bamboo-craftsman-tokyo-japan-fishing-rod-japan-fishing-show-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /> Yamano-sensei and me at the 2017 Japan Fishing Show[/caption]

<!--more-->

As outlined in <a href="http://www.discovertenkara.com/blog/blog-31.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> article on Discover Tenkara the first basic tenkara bamboo rod that I built under the tutelage of Masayuki Yamano-sensei was in the Fall of 2016. After that one was finished Yamano-sensei invited me to build a more advanced rod with him. This project would take just over 15 months for me to complete. I did about 15% of the work and while I was away Yamano-san would work on my rod, preparing it for my next building session.

There is an absolutely wonderful article on the Discover Tenkara site about the process - it is very thorough and precise. It would be a waste of time for me to go into the details here when their write up is easily accessed by anyone with interest in the subject. I encourage you to check it out <a href="http://www.discovertenkara.com/bamboo-tenkara-rod.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>

During my visits to Yamano-sensei's shop my time was divided evenly between working on the rod and drinking and eating. My good friend Go Ishii visited the shop with me too; sometimes to work on his own rod or to film and photograph me working on mine. I looked forward to the dining as much as working on the rod. Every time I visited not only did I learn more about working with bamboo but I also tasted some rare Japanese delicacies. It was a time that I will look back on with fine memories for a long time.

<strong>Food</strong>

<strong>Sensei</strong>
[kadence_gallery id="5451"]

The wife of my sensei, Hiromi Yamano-san also took me under her wing teaching me the basics of the Japanese calligraphy art form known as Shodö 書道. On my last visit she also made me a custom Hanko 判子 - see the photo below so that I could put my mark on my completed bamboo rod sleeve. I really love how the "I" and the "T" together look very similar to my son's name 正. On another visit she also cooked up a delicious dish called Nimono 煮付け from her secret recipe (see the first gallery "Food"). Nimono is fish boiled in shiru stock flavored with sake, soy sauce, and a small amount of sweetening. It was absolutely delicious!

<strong>Shop</strong>
[kadence_gallery id="5427"]

Yamano-sensei has two shops, the street front one and the main shop behind his home. Many times during my visits to work on my rod a customer would stop by to have a rod straightened and even once to have a 100 year old ayu rod turned into a herabuna rod. If it's made out of bamboo Yamano-sensei can do anything you can dream up.

And without further ado, here is my rod.

I have been agonizing over this article for over two months now; tweaking it, adding photos, and trying to do justice to not only the Yamano family but the experience of learning from them. Eventually you just have to commit though, so after numerous revisions I have gone ahead and clicked the "Publish" button. Thank you Masayuki and Hiromi Yamano for teaching me but most importantly for your friendship.

Also I would be remiss without thanking my friend <a href="https://youtu.be/gKome67nHWQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go Ishii</a>. Without him there by my side during each and every one of my visits to Yamano-sensei's shop I would have not learned nearly as much as I did. Through his excellent translating I was better able to grasp the ancient art form of edo wazao. If you ever find yourself in Japan look him up, tell him Isaac sent you, and ask him about the <a href="http://www.fallfishtenkara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Fugu-fish-sperm-milt-japan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">フグ魚精</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Back in February three friends and I rented an RV and spent some time touring Hokkaido on our skis. I have been super busy with an international move and ticking off items on my <em>"must do before leaving Japan"</em> list - hence the month plus delay in posting this trip report. As I write this I am sitting in Los Angeles enjoying some exquisite Mexican food, In-N-Out, and driving on highways that don't cost an arm and a leg - but I am missing my friends and this upcoming keiryu tenkara and sansai season, which is sure to be epic! If you can get to Japan this year <strong>DO IT</strong>!

Headed up Furanodake.[/caption]

I am experimenting with a new format; heavy on photos and light on words - because as you know they say "pictures speak a thousand words". Here's a map of where we went... If you want more beta <a href="http://104.248.67.90/about/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit me up</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today is a short post to to share the work of a talented artist that I recently discovered named Yasunari Murakami. Like many of the good things I have discovered, I came across Murakami-san's artwork via Twitter (thank you <span class="username u-dir" dir="ltr"><a class="ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/WakabayashiWalk">@<b class="u-linkComplex-target">WakabayashiWalk</b></a>)</span>

Mr. Murakami-san was born in 1955 in Gifu Prefecture. He is the author of the famous book series titled "Yamame Pink" (ヤマメのピンクシリーズ), which I have purchased a copy of for my son. Over the years his artwork has won him many awards.

While I have never met Murakami-san, I enjoy his style of art, which has a decidedly Japanese vibe to it. He has a <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/Murakamiyasunari+Museum/@34.914015,139.106392,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6019c34f6c172685:0x1c95d290d6f4217e!8m2!3d34.914015!4d139.108586?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gallery</a> in Shizuoka, if you are in the area stop by. I purchased a few items, which I plan to decorate my man cave with. Mr. Murakami-san personifies many fish species, some of which are not native to Japan - for example the California state fish the Golden Trout (soon to be new home).

Mr. Yasunari Murakami-san has a <a href="http://www.murakami-museum.co.jp/murakami_tuhan/tuhan.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web store</a> too but I am not sure if he ships outside of Japan. He can be reached by email at <a href="mailto:izu@murakami-museum.co.jp">izu@murakami-museum.co.jp</a>

<em>Author's Note: I received absolutely no compensation from Yasunari Murakami to write this review. I paid for the artwork and took it upon myself to review it.
