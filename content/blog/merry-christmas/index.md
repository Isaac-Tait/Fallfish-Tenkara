<p class="mb-2">Merry Christmas from Japan!</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Just a quick post to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a happy Holiday season! I promise I'll write more next month ;)

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">It was a wonderful Christmas here in Japan, the weather was sunny and only a little chilly. We picked up a famous Japanese Christmas Cake, which was delectable(!) for a potluck with friends. You can read more about them <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/12/16/369830094/a-christmas-cake-that-isn-t-about-christmas-at-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">May your Christmas be filled with cheer</p>
