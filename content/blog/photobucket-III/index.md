<p>Musings</p>
<p class="mt-2 mb-2">This, the third installment of my photobucket series is a hodgepodge collage of random photos from my adventures in Japan. Most speak for themselves - others have a backstory. It has been a while since my last substantial blog post but I have been keeping busy doing some under the hood tuning of the backend of Fallfish Tenkara. To name a few of the things that have been taking up a lot of my time lately: HTTP/2, DNS, CDN, caches, themes, JS, CSS, <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/brainfuck/" target="_blank">Brainfu#*</a> (link <em>is probably</em> NSFW FYI), Apache, droplets, VPS, SSH, SFTP, permissions, WP, and AWS.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">In other news the Sierra Nevada is getting hammered with <a href="https://unofficialalpine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storm after storm</a>, which is good because California really needs the water. Of course I am a little jealous, winter is just getting started here in Japan (at least Honshu Island - Hokkaido has been absolutely slammed with snow in the last month or so). I will be headed up to Hokkaido for the Sapporo Snow Festival in February. Looking forward to that trip!</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Also, in case you missed it (and read this far) the latest issue of Tenkara Angler published on December 1. Yours truly wrote a piece titled "The Theology of Tenkara, Trout, and Japan". Check it out!
