<p class="mb-2">It has been a hot minute since I last did a <a href="http://104.248.67.90/japan-photobucket-i/">Photobucket</a> post (9 weeks to be exact) and now more than ever, I've got more photos than I know what to do with. Most of these photos were taken this past spring. Enjoy :)</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Naturally I was curious so I googled かちかち山 (which translates roughly to Tick Mountain) and it turns out there is an ancient Japanese folk-story about a Racoon Dog and a Rabbit. I will warn you it is pretty dark and demented though. Read it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kachi-kachi_Yama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>
